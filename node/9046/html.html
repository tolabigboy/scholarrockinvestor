the Employee&rsquo;s execution of this Agreement, the Employee&rsquo;s employment with the Company and the performance of the Employee&rsquo;s
proposed duties for the Company will not violate any obligations the Employee may have to any such previous employer or other party.
In the Employee&rsquo;s work for the Company, the Employee will not disclose or make use of any information in violation of any agreements
with or rights of any such previous employer or other party, and the Employee will not bring to the premises of the Company any copies

by the Company. The Employee&rsquo;s full cooperation in connection with such claims or actions shall include, but not be limited to,

from any breach by the Employee of the Continuing Obligations, and that in any event money damages would be an inadequate remedy for
any such breach. Accordingly, subject to Section 8 of this Agreement, the Employee agrees that if the Employee breaches, or proposes
to breach, any portion of this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies that it may have, to an injunction
or other appropriate equitable relief to restrain any such breach without showing or proving any actual damage to the Company. In addition,
in the event the Employee breaches, or proposes to breach, any portion of the Continuing Obligations during a period when the Employee
is receiving severance payments pursuant to Section 4 or Section 5 hereof, the Company shall have the right to suspend or terminate such
severance payments. Such suspension or termination shall not limit the Company&rsquo;s other options with respect to relief for such
breach and shall not relieve the Employee of the Employee&rsquo;s duties under this Agreement.</FONT></P>

the two (2) years preceding the termination of my employment, for as long as the Company elects to enforce said post-employment non-competition

has unlawfully taken Company property to the extent permitted by applicable law. I acknowledge and agree that any payments I receive pursuant
to this Section 8(a) shall reduce (and shall not be in addition to) any severance or separation pay that I am otherwise entitled to receive
from the Company pursuant to an agreement, plan or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in any other agreement between the Company and me, &ldquo;Cause&rdquo; shall mean a reasonable and good faith basis for the Company to

Company substantial and irrevocable damage and therefore, in the event of such breach, the Company, in addition to such other remedies
which may be available, will be entitled to specific performance and other injunctive relief, without the posting of a bond. If I violate
this Agreement, in addition to all other remedies available to the Company at law, in equity, and under contract, I agree that I am obligated
to pay all the Company&rsquo;s costs of enforcement of this Agreement, including attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses.</P>

Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing by the Company. The failure of the Company to require my performance of any term
or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver of any breach of this Agreement, shall not prevent the Company&rsquo;s subsequent enforcement

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><U>Scholar Rock</U>&nbsp;is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company
focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases in which signaling by protein
growth factors plays a fundamental role.&nbsp;Scholar Rock&nbsp;is creating a pipeline of novel product candidates with the potential
to transform the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, and fibrosis.
Scholar Rock&rsquo;s approach to targeting the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled it to develop a&nbsp;<U>proprietary
platform</U>&nbsp;for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target these signaling proteins
at the cellular level. By developing product candidates that act in the disease microenvironment, the Company intends to avoid the historical
challenges associated with inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect.&nbsp;Scholar Rock&nbsp;believes its focus on biologically
validated growth factors may facilitate a more efficient development path.</P>
