Growth factors are naturally occurring proteins that typically act as signaling molecules between cells and play a fundamental role in regulating a variety of normal cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation. Current therapeutic approaches to treating diseases in which growth factors play a fundamental role involve directly targeting the active form of the growth factor or its receptor systemically throughout the body. These approaches have suffered from a variety of shortcomings, including lack of pathway selectivity, lack of target selectivity, and non-localized target inhibition.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our innovative approach is rooted in our structural biology insights into the mechanism by which certain growth factors are activated in close proximity to the cell surface.

Myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle mass expressed primarily in skeletal muscle tissue, and a member of the TGF&#946; superfamily, a group of more than 30 related growth factors that mediate diverse biological processes. Vertebrate animals that lack the myostatin gene display increased muscle mass and strength relative to their normal counterparts, but are otherwise healthy. We believe that selective inhibition of myostatin activation may increase muscle strength and promote a clinically meaningful increase in motor function. As a result, we have focused our initial development efforts for apitegromab on the treatment of SMA. SMA is a rare, and often fatal, genetic disorder arising from a deficiency of a protein known as &#8220;survival of motor neuron,&#8221; or SMN. This disease typically manifests in young children and is characterized by atrophy of the voluntary muscles of the limbs and trunk and dramatically reduced normal neuromuscular function. An estimated 30,000 to 35,000 patients suffer from SMA in the U.S. and Europe alone, and many more patients are affected worldwide. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In preclinical studies, we have shown that the antibody selectively avoids interaction with other closely related growth factors that play distinct physiological roles. We observed multi-fold increases in serum latent myostatin levels in   mouse models of both early and late SMN restoration and that apitegromab promoted increased strength (as measured by torque generation) in SMN-deficient mice. In a Phase 1 trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (&quot;PK&quot;) /pharmacodynamic (&#8220;PD&#8221;) profile of apitegromab in adult healthy volunteers, there were no dose-limiting   toxicities and robust and sustained target engagement following administration of apitegromab was observed. The apitegromab TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing in patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA. In October 2020, we reported results from a six-month interim efficacy, safety and PK/PD analysis of patients across the three cohorts of the trial. See &#8220;TOPAZ Phase 2 Trial Interim Analysis&#8221; below. We believe that apitegromab has the potential to be the first muscle-directed therapy, which is aimed at improving motor function in patients with SMA and could be used as a monotherapy or in conjunction with SMN upregulator therapies (i.e., therapies that upregulate the expression of SMN, such as SMN splicing modulators or gene therapy).  Top-line data for the 12-month treatment period of the TOPAZ Phase 2 trial are expected in the second quarter of 2021. Twelve-month data could provide </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">6</p></div></div>

We believe that the role of apitegromab as a muscle-directed therapy has broad potential beyond SMA, spanning a number of muscle disorders in which fast-twitch fibers may play an important role in motor function, such as Becker&#8217;s muscular dystrophy, Duchenne&#8217;s muscular dystrophy and Pompe disease. In some settings, we believe that disease- stabilizing therapy may be necessary to address the underlying defect, which can then be complemented by the potential motor function-building benefit of apitegromab. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is also increasing recognition of the important role of skeletal muscle in modulating metabolic physiology, highlighting a potential therapeutic opportunity for myostatin blockade. For example, evidence is emerging that blockade of the myostatin pathway may reduce the mass of visceral fat, thereby alleviating a significant driver of cardiometabolic pathology.  In these disease settings, specificity may be an important key to unlocking the potential of blocking myostatin in the therapeutic area. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We are therefore considering the investigation of apitegromab in multiple indications beyond SMA and have efforts underway to evaluate these opportunities (including preclinical and translational research, development path assessments, and commercial assessments). We plan to identify a second indication for apitegromab in 2021.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">SRK-181 in cancer immunotherapy</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Our second antibody product candidate, SRK-181, a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the activation of latent TGF&#946;1 is in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors that are resistant to anti-PD-(L)1 therapies. Increased signaling by TGF&#946;1 is a key driver of a number of disease-relevant processes, including immune system evasion by cancer cells, bone marrow fibrosis associated with hematological disorders, and tissue and organ fibrosis. Historically, selectively targeting TGF&#946;1 signaling has been challenging due to the inability of either small molecule inhibitors or antibodies to avoid off-target inhibition of other, closely related growth factors, TGF&#946;2 and TGF&#946;3. Treatment of animals with these non-selective TGF&#946; inhibitors has been associated with a range of toxicities, most notably cardiac toxicity. In preclinical studies of our antibodies, we have observed specific inhibition of TGF&#946;1 activation <i style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</i> and immunomodulatory and antifibrotic activity in multiple disease models <i style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</i>. A 28-day pilot nonclinical toxicology study in rats of our leading antibody did not observe any drug-<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">related toxicity up to the highest dose (100 mg/kg weekly) tested in the study. In the same study, we tested non-selective TGF&#946; inhibitors and observed the published toxicities, including cardiac toxicity as well as death.  We have also completed four-week GLP toxicology studies in rats and non-human primates and no SRK-181 related adverse effects were observed up to the highest evaluated dose of 200 mg/kg per week and 300 mg/kg per week, respectively. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In many human cancers, TGF&#946; signaling is associated with lack of response to PD-(L)1 blockade, particularly in patients with tumors harboring an immune excluded phenotype (i.e., CD8+ T cells present in nearby stroma but excluded from the tumor parenchyma). We have observed multiple mouse models that recapitulate the immune-excluded phenotype and are resistant to PD-1 blockade become responsive to the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1, the murine version of SRK-181, and an anti- PD-1 antibody. These models, including the MBT-2 bladder cancer model, the Cloudman S91 melanoma model and the EMT6 breast cancer model, were poorly responsive or unresponsive to single agent treatment with either anti-PD-1 or SRK-181-mIgG1, with little or no effect on tumor growth. However, the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1 and anti-PD-1 resulted in tumor regressions. Furthermore, the combination treatment led to significant survival benefit in both models.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Our DRAGON Phase 1 trial of SRK-181 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors is ongoing and will investigate if SRK-181 in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy may overcome primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and lead to anti-tumor responses. The trial consists of two parts: Part A (dose escalation of SRK-181 as a single-agent or in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy) and Part B (dose expansion evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy).

For example, TGF&#946;1 is produced by cells as a single protein which is then enzymatically processed by the cells into two distinct and physically separated domains&#160;&#8212; the mature growth factor and the remaining portion of the original protein, referred to as the prodomain&#160;&#8212; which remain associated as part of a complex. This secreted complex is latent, or inactive, and must first be activated to carry out its normal function in a highly localized tissue or disease microenvironment. In a seminal peer-reviewed publication in 2011, Dr.&#160;Springer elucidated a new understanding of the mechanism of activation of the latent growth factor complex among members of the TGF&#946; superfamily by solving a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of this latent form of TGF&#946;1 (as illustrated in the graphic below).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><img src="../../../cdn.kscope.io/2363eb7fcef392bd64103c1f8ecb1203-srrk-20201231x10k006.jpg" alt="Graphic" style="display:inline-block;height:250.1pt;left:0%;padding-bottom:0.4pt;position:relative;top:0pt;width:485.3pt;" /></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Structural representation of the latent form of TGF&#946;</span>1</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">wherein the prodomain wraps around the active growth factor</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">10</p></div></div>

The prodomain, though physically separated from the mature growth factor domain, forms&#160;a &#8220;cage&#8221; around the active form of TGF&#946;1, blocking the growth factor from signaling through its receptor. Only when the cage is &#8220;unlocked&#8221; by a precursor activation event can the growth factor be released and mediate its effects in the local microenvironment. Dr.&#160;Springer further hypothesized that this phenomenon likely holds true for most members of the TGF&#946; superfamily, though the exact nature of the activation event, such as integrin binding or enzymatic cleavage, may differ among members of the superfamily. Importantly, while many growth factors are structurally very similar, their cages are structurally diverse, and this provides the basis for our approach to improved selectivity.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We believe that there are several important advantages to our approach of targeting the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors over conventional therapeutic approaches, which inhibit mature growth factors or their receptors systemically throughout the body:</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">targeting the latent precursor allows intervention at the site of action, within the microenvironment of the diseased tissue. Because our antibodies specifically bind the latent forms of the growth factors, we can prevent the activation of the growth factors. Given that many growth factors act primarily within the microenvironment where they are activated, as opposed to exerting their effects systemically, we believe that prevention of activation is a preferred mode of action for achieving improved outcomes. In contrast, traditional approaches to targeting growth factor signaling are focused on inhibiting the growth factor after it has been activated and released systemically;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">targeting the latent precursor allows heightened selectivity among structurally related growth factors, which we believe could limit off-target effects. For example, two members of the TGF&#946; superfamily, myostatin and GDF11, are 90% identical in their growth factor domains. Therefore, many of the traditional inhibitors that target myostatin also inadvertently inhibit GDF11. Similarly, most of the known inhibitors of TGF&#946; are pan-inhibitors, meaning that they do not distinguish among the three isoforms of TGF&#946;, namely, TGF&#946;1, TGF&#946; 2 and TGF&#946;3. Despite the sequence similarities of the active forms of these growth factors, their cages are structurally diverse. We have been able to harness this diversity to generate antibodies that specifically bind the inactive growth factor precursors and inhibit activation of a particular growth factor of interest, but not others that are closely related; and</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">targeting these precursor forms in the disease microenvironment, we believe we can interfere with the disease process while minimizing the effects on the normal physiological processes mediated by growth factors.</span></td></tr></table><div style="margin-top:12pt;"></div><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">To enable our novel approach, we have built a proprietary platform that is rooted in our structural biology insights into activation of latent growth factor precursors.

By targeting the latent form of myostatin and specifically inhibiting its activation in muscle, we believe apitegromab holds considerable promise in improving motor function in patients with SMA. We completed enrollment of a total of 58 patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA across 16 study sites in the United States and Europe in our TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial. The trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous apitegromab dosed every four weeks (&#8220;Q4W&#8221;), over a 12-month treatment period. In October 2020, we announced positive six-month interim analysis results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial. Interim analysis showed that treatment with apitegromab led to improvements in Hammersmith scale scores (the primary efficacy endpoint) in all three cohorts of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA. Dose response in efficacy was observed across all evaluated timepoints in the double-blind, randomized portion of the trial (Cohort 3). Top-line data for the 12-month treatment period of the TOPAZ Phase 2 trial are expected in the second quarter of 2021 and could provide additional insights on the potential durability of effect and the potential for further improvements in motor function, as well as additional safety data, together with PK, PD and ADA data. </span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.26;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:36pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.26;text-align:left;">Identify the next indication for apitegromab. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:1.26;text-align:left;white-space:pre-wrap;">Our goal is to maximize the value of apitegromab by exploring its potential across SMA types and in other myostatin-related indications.

We believe that inhibition of the activation of myostatin may promote a clinically meaningful increase in motor function. In the second quarter of 2019, we initiated our TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial to evaluate apitegromab for the treatment of SMA. We completed enrollment of 58 patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA across all three cohorts in January 2020; there has been one discontinuation in the 12-month treatment period. We reported six-month interim efficacy, safety and PK/PD data in October 2020 demonstrating the potential of apitegromab in the treatment of SMA. Top-line data for the 12-month treatment period of the TOPAZ Phase 2 trial are expected in the second quarter of 2021.

It is characterized by the loss of motor neurons, atrophy of the voluntary muscles of the limbs and trunk and progressive muscle weakness. Disease severity in SMA can range from patients who die soon after birth to patients who live into adulthood with varying degrees of morbidity. The underlying pathology of SMA is caused by insufficient production of a protein known as &#8220;survival of motor neuron,&#8221; or SMN. The SMN protein, essential for the survival of motor neurons, is encoded by two genes, SMN1 and SMN2.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:72pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">SMN1 genes produce the majority of functional SMN protein; healthy individuals have one or two functional copies of SMN1, while patients with SMA have mutations in or deletions of both copies of the gene.</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:72pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">SMN2 genes produce only 10% to 20% of functional SMN protein and an individual&#8217;s copy number of the SMN2 gene can range from zero to eight.

An estimated 30,000 to 35,000 patients suffer from SMA in the U.S. and Europe alone. Patients with SMA can be categorized as one of four types, Type&#160;1 through Type&#160;4. More than 85% of SMA patients currently living are estimated as having Type&#160;2 or Type&#160;3 disease.

Patients with Type&#160;1 SMA suffer from respiratory compromise and often require mechanical ventilation shortly after birth. Type&#160;1 infants are never able to sit without support. Type&#160;1 SMA is the most common form of the disease, and accounts for 58% of patients born with SMA. Historically, only 1% of patients with Type&#160;1 disease survive beyond two&#160;years of age without mechanical respiratory support. Type 1 SMA represents only 14% of patients with SMA, although recent therapies may extend patient lifespans.

We believe that the advancement of muscle-directed therapy will be necessary to address this important gap.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">SMN upregulator therapies (which also can be categorized as SMN corrector therapies) are aimed at addressing the SMN deficiency to prevent further motor neuron deterioration. This category includes antisense oligonucleotide and small molecule approaches to increase SMN2 expression as well as gene therapy to deliver the SMN1 gene. The primary benefit of such an approach appears to be to address the SMN deficiency and to modify the course of disease. Early intervention at a very young age is therefore thought to be essential to prevent significant motor functional deterioration. However, for the vast majority of SMA patients living today, this early intervention window has been missed, and such individuals suffer from severe functional impairment. Thus, regardless of the precise nature or mechanism of action for any given SMN upregulator therapy, we believe that most SMA patients will continue to experience clinically significant functional deficits. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">To address this need, apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-directed therapy for SMA. We envision the potential for apitegromab to be a critical complement to any SMN upregulator therapy in patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA in order to drive absolute increases in functional performance over baseline. We also view apitegromab as having potential in the treatment of Type 1 SMA as well as presymptomatic SMA in conjunction with SMN upregulator therapy. Our vision is that apitegromab has the potential to be the backbone treatment for the broadest group of patients with SMA.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 36pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Myostatin in SMA and Challenges with Traditional Approaches</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Apitegromab, is a selective inhibitor of the activation of latent myostatin that acts locally within skeletal muscle. Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor 8 (&#8220;GDF8&#8221;), is a member of the TGF&#946; superfamily and is produced by skeletal muscle cells. As with other tissues and organs in the human body, healthy muscle homeostasis is maintained by a proper balance of growth signals, or anabolic stimuli, and breakdown signals, or catabolic stimuli. In humans, the anabolic stimuli that drive muscle growth are proteins, such as the human growth hormone and the insulin-like growth factor 1. In contrast, myostatin is a catabolic agent that functions as a negative regulator of muscle mass.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Skeletal muscle fibers are generally classified as fast-twitch or slow-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers play a key role in motor activities, such as those involving quick bursts of strength. In contrast, slow-twitch fibers are important for endurance activities. Animals lacking functional myostatin genes, or its receptor, have larger muscles and increased strength compared to normal animals. While the absence of myostatin does lead to overall increases in muscle mass, a preferential effect on muscles enriched for fast-twitch muscle fibers has been observed in animals. Such animals are otherwise healthy and live a normal life-span.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Because of its role in regulating muscle mass, myostatin has been a popular target for a variety of drug development programs. There have been two general approaches to trying to inhibit the signaling of myostatin in humans. The first is to develop an antibody, or an antibody-like molecule, that binds to mature myostatin in circulation and prevents its ability to signal through its receptor, the ActRIIb receptor. The second is to develop an antibody to the ActRIIb receptor itself, or a soluble decoy of the ActRIIb receptor, with a goal of preventing myostatin signaling through its receptor. Both of these approaches, however, have significant limitations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As a member of the TGF&#946; superfamily, mature myostatin shares considerable structural similarity with other family members. For example, the active form of myostatin and its most closely related family member, GDF11, are 90% identical in the growth factor domains, making it extremely challenging to identify antibodies that are truly specific for myostatin and do not interfere with other targets. Moreover, attempts to interrupt myostatin signaling through its receptor are complicated by the fact that the ActRIIb receptor, in addition to being the receptor for myostatin, is also the receptor for a number of related family members, including GDF11, activins and other growth factors. Attempts to block the signaling of myostatin by targeting its receptor therefor inevitably interfere with the signaling of these other growth factors, many of which are involved in normal biological processes unrelated to muscle.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">16</p></div></div>

For example, in a Phase&#160;2 trial in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy reported in 2017, a soluble decoy of the ActRIIb receptor resulted in bleeding side effects believed by the sponsor to be unrelated to inhibition of myostatin signaling, but instead related to the inhibition of signaling by certain other members of the TGF&#946; superfamily known to be important in the maintenance of vascular integrity. These side effects resulted in termination of the clinical program. More recently, results from a clinical trial were reported showing that treatment of patients with an antibody to the ActRIIb receptor resulted in suppression of the levels of follicle stimulating hormone, an important reproductive hormone. In this trial, the sponsor believed that these effects were likely related to inhibition of signaling through the ActRIIb receptor.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Our Solution</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Utilizing our proprietary platform, we targeted the precursor form of myostatin and generated apitegromab, a novel, highly selective inhibitor of the activation of myostatin from its inactive precursor in skeletal muscles, where myostatin resides and signals upon activation. While mature myostatin is 90% identical in the growth factor domain to its most closely related TGF&#946; superfamily member, GDF11, the prodomain that cages mature myostatin and keeps it in its latent precursor form is only 52% identical to the GDF11 prodomain. As a result, in preclinical studies, we observed that apitegromab bound to latent myostatin with a high level of selectivity, while having no binding to, and no effect on, the activation of related TGF&#946; family members.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><img src="../../../cdn.kscope.io/2363eb7fcef392bd64103c1f8ecb1203-srrk-20201231x10k008.jpg" alt="Graphic" style="display:inline-block;height:189pt;width:294.6pt;" /></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Apitegromab showed dose-dependent inhibition of latent myostatin activation</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">in an in vitro activation assay and had no effect on latent GDF11 activation.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;">We believe that the therapeutic potential for apitegromab in improving motor function is more optimal when a given disease bears certain features. Based on our translational and preclinical efforts, we have formulated a set of guiding principles to inform indication selection within the category of neuromuscular disease. As summarized in the table below, we believe that the pathobiological and clinical characteristics of SMA are well-<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">aligned with these guiding principles. Since myostatin regulates muscle catabolism rather than anabolism, we believe that having a background of anabolic capacity is important to drive muscle growth in the setting of myostatin inhibition. Anabolic capacity is most robust in younger individuals and diminishes as one ages. SMA is a genetic disorder with onset commonly in childhood, and the initial focus of the development program will be in children and young adults.  Furthermore, in SMA, there is a significant but incomplete loss of motor neurons, ensuring at least some intact signaling between skeletal muscle and nerve. In addition, generally, there are also no apparent structural abnormalities in the skeletal muscle. The partial loss of motor neurons causes substantial atrophy of fast-twitch muscle fibers that in turn leads to many of the motor function impairments. Validated outcome measures are available for SMA clinical trials that are relevant to fast-twitch fiber activity. These outcome measures, such as the HFMSE, assess a large number of motor activities that involve short-term bursts of strength, which are driven by fast-twitch muscle fibers. These endpoints therefore measure an outcome that may be more likely to be directly affected by apitegromab.</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">17</p></div></div>

Following placebo treatment, there was no meaningful change in the latent myostatin biomarker concentrations. Following single doses of apitegromab at dose levels of 3 mg/kg or greater, marked increases in latent myostatin biomarker concentrations in the serum, by at least an order of magnitude, were observed following apitegromab treatment. This finding demonstrates successful target engagement and provides initial proof-of-mechanism in humans of our therapeutic approach of targeting the latent form of growth factors. The observation also corroborates our biological understanding that the vast majority of drug target (pro and latent forms of myostatin) resides within skeletal muscle rather than within the systemic circulation.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><img src="../../../cdn.kscope.io/2363eb7fcef392bd64103c1f8ecb1203-srrk-20201231x10k010.jpg" alt="Graphic" style="display:inline-block;height:339pt;width:300pt;" /></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Apitegromab engages latent myostatin in Phase 1 clinical trial subjects</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">TOPAZ Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Trial</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">We completed enrollment of 58 patients in our TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab in SMA in January 2020.

We view each of the cohorts being evaluated in the TOPAZ trial as representing a significant proportion of patients suffering from SMA.  </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The primary efficacy objectives being evaluated in the TOPAZ trial, HFMSE and RHS, are clinically meaningful outcome measures validated for SMA. These endpoints assess motor tasks involving short-term bursts of strength and thus involve fast-twitch fiber function. As the hypothesized effect of myostatin blockade under investigation is to drive increases in fast-twitch fiber function, we believe these endpoints are of direct relevance in assessing the clinical effect of apitegromab.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Our overall approach to the efficacy analysis is informed by SMA disease biology, the anticipated mechanism of action of apitegromab, the effects of SMN upregulators, and available clinical data on SMA. The primary effect of SMN upregulator therapy appears to be to address the SMN deficiency and to modify the disease course; thus, the key in preventing significant motor functional deterioration is intervening at a very young age. For most patients with SMA, however, this window for early intervention is no longer available. As a result, these individuals have already suffered considerable atrophy and motor function impairment. Natural history data indicate that most patients with Type 2 or 3 SMA, other than very young individuals, generally have a stable functional baseline over a 12-month period as evidenced by their HFMSE scores. A one-point improvement on the Hammersmith scale is considered meaningful on an individual level and a spontaneous improvement of 3 or more points from one&#8217;s baseline would be a notable divergence from the otherwise expected course of disease for most patients.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">TOPAZ Six-Month Interim Efficacy, Safety, and PK/PD Results </b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">A six-month interim efficacy, safety and PK/PD analysis of patients across the three cohorts of the trial was reported in October 2020. The interim analysis results showed that treatment with apitegromab led to improvements in Hammersmith scale scores (HFMSE and RHS; the primary efficacy endpoints) in all three cohorts of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA and no safety signals were identified.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Top-line data for the 12-month treatment period of the TOPAZ Phase 2 trial are expected in the second quarter of 2021 and could provide additional insights on the potential durability of effect and the potential for further improvements in motor function, as well as additional safety data, together with PK, PD, and ADA data.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">20</p></div></div>

In some settings, we believe that disease-stabilizing therapy may be necessary to address the underlying defect, which can then be complemented by the potential motor function-building benefit of apitegromab. In settings in which the defect may be less severe and/or the disease may have a slower rate of progression, apitegromab may have the potential to serve as a monotherapy. Examples of such diseases include (but are not limited to) Becker&#8217;s muscular dystrophy, Duchenne&#8217;s muscular dystrophy and Pompe disease.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">There is also increasing recognition of the important role of skeletal muscle in modulating metabolic physiology, highlighting a potential therapeutic opportunity for myostatin blockade. For example, evidence is emerging that blockade of the myostatin pathway can reduce the mass of visceral fat, a significant driver of cardiometabolic pathophysiology. Excessive fat mass and metabolic abnormalities have been observed in many muscle atrophy states, such as SMA and spinal cord injury. More broadly, reducing visceral fat mass, or improving body compositions (e.g., enhanced muscle-to-fat ratios), may be a promising therapeutic strategy to address a wide range of disorders, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (&#8220;NASH&#8221;), diabetes, and obesity.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Thus, a wide range of potential therapeutic applications may be envisioned for apitegromab. We are considering the investigation of apitegromab in multiple indications beyond SMA and have efforts underway to evaluate these opportunities (including preclinical and translational research, clinical development and regulatory path assessments, and commercial assessments). </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our Second Product Candidate - Inhibitor of Latent TGF&#946;1 Activation</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">TGF&#946;1 is also a member of the TGF&#946; superfamily and increased signaling by TGF&#946;1 is a key driver of a number of disease-relevant processes, including immune system evasion by cancer cells, bone marrow fibrosis associated with hematological disorders, and tissue and organ fibrosis. Historically, selectively targeting TGF&#946;1 signaling has been challenging due to the inability of both small molecule inhibitors and antibodies to avoid off-target inhibition of other, closely related growth factors, TGF&#946;2 and TGF&#946;3. Treatment of animals with these non-selective TGF&#946; inhibitors has been associated with a range of toxicities, most notably cardiac toxicity. Furthermore, since each of these growth factors signals through the same TGF&#946; receptor, ALK5, inhibitors of the TGF&#946; receptor kinase suffer from similar dose-limiting toxicities. Using our proprietary platform, we have generated highly specific and locally acting inhibitors of the activation of TGF&#946;1 that, in our preclinical studies, showed no detectable inhibition of the activation of TGF&#946;2 or TGF&#946;3.

This complex is further associated with one of a number of &quot;presenting molecules&quot; which when secreted serve to tether the latent precursor in specific locations in the body. TGF&#946;1 is produced by a variety of cell types, including fibroblasts, which deposit latent TGF&#946;1 in connective tissue, as well as regulatory T cells and macrophages, which display latent TGF&#946;1 on their cell surfaces. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">In a seminal peer-reviewed publication in 2011, by solving a high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of the latent form of TGF&#946;1, Dr.&#160;Springer elucidated a new understanding of the mechanism that underlies the activation of latent precursor </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">23</p></div></div>

This research explained at a molecular level why the secreted form of TGF</span>&#946;1 is inactive. The prodomain, though physically separated from the mature growth factor domain, forms&#160;a &quot;cage&quot; around the active form of TGF&#946;1, blocking the ability of the growth factor to signal through its receptor. Integrin proteins are able to unlock the &quot;cage&quot; by binding to the prodomain of the latent TGF&#946;1 complex and applying force to pull the complex open, allowing the mature growth factor to be released and signal in its microenvironment. While mature TGF&#946;1 shares a high degree of structural similarity with its closely related family members, TGF&#946;2 and TGF&#946;3, their respective cages are structurally diverse. By taking advantage of the differences among the prodomains, together with our understanding of the activation mechanism and ability to recapitulate the activation mechanism <i style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</i>, we were able to identify multiple highly selective inhibitors of the activation of latent TGF&#946;1. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">By specifically targeting the TGF&#946;1 isoform, <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">we believe we have the key to unlock the power of checkpoint inhibitors and meaningfully increase response rates across multiple solid tumor types.

Immune checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1/PD-L1, have therefore become key therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment. By inhibiting these proteins, the brakes on the immune system are released, allowing the T cells to kill the cancer cells. There are currently multiple approved checkpoint inhibitor therapies that target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">24</p></div></div>

Indeed, TGF&#946; is upregulated in many animal models of fibrosis, and overexpression of TGF&#946; </span><i style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</i><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> induces fibrotic changes. Furthermore, TGF&#946; inhibition in animal models has been shown to reduce fibrosis in models of hepatic, renal and cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, fresolisumab, an inhibitor of all three TGF&#946; isoforms, was evaluated in an open-label clinical trial involving patients with systemic sclerosis, a fibrotic connective tissue disease.  Improvement in clinical skin disease as measured by the modified Rodnan skin score, a commonly used measure of skin thickness, was observed, although bleeding episodes were also reported in this trial. These data suggest that novel approaches to targeting TGF&#946; signaling may have broad applicability to the treatment of fibrotic disease.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">For our TGF&#946; inhibitor discovery and development efforts aimed at the treatment of fibrosis, certain context-independent and context-dependent antibodies that have been observed to specifically inhibit TGF&#946;1 activation are the subject of our Gilead Collaboration Agreement, and their further optimization, characterization, and anticipated product candidate development will take place in the context of this strategic collaboration. In December 2019, we announced the achievement of a $25 million preclinical milestone under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement for the successful demonstration of efficacy in preclinical <i style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</i> proof-of-concept studies in the most advanced program of the collaboration.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Context-dependent TGF&#946;1 Inhibitors</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">As mentioned, when latent TGF&#946;1 is secreted from cells, it is further associated with a third protein, referred to as a presenting molecule. The presenting molecules are covalently bound to the prodomain and serve to tether the latent TGF&#946;1 complex in a particular microenvironment. Unlike TGF&#946;1, a given presenting molecule&#39;s expression pattern is restricted to particular cellular and tissue environments. For example, the presenting molecule GARP is found primarily on regulatory T cells, the presenting molecules LTBP1 and LTBP3 are localized to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix, and the presenting molecule LRRC33 is found primarily on certain myeloid lineage cells such as macrophages.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">29</p></div></div>

For example, we have identified antibodies that specifically bind to and inhibit the activation of GARP-presented latent TGF&#946;1 on regulatory T cells with no detectable binding to latent TGF&#946;1 associated with other presenting molecules. These antibodies are the subject of our license agreement with Janssen. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">We also have an active discovery program to identify antibodies that specifically bind to and inhibit the activation of LRRC33-presented latent TGF&#946;1 with no cross-reactivity to LTBP1-, LTBP3- or GARP- presented latent TGF&#946;1. We believe that such antibodies may have therapeutic potential for specific oncology and cancer immunotherapy applications where selective modulation of myeloid lineage cells is desirable, for example inhibition of tumor-associated macrophages. In addition, we have a related program to identify antibodies that specifically inhibit the activation of both LRRC33- and GARP-presented latent TGF&#946;1, with no cross-reactivity to LTBP1- or LTBP3-presented latent TGF&#946;1. We believe such antibodies could have broad inhibitory activity against TGF&#946;1 in the immune system for cancer immunotherapy, while avoiding inhibition of TGF&#946;1 in other tissues. We have identified antibodies that potentially meet the desired binding specificities, and these are currently undergoing characterization and further optimization.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">License Agreements</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:9pt;text-indent:-9pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Gilead Collaboration </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">On December 19, 2018 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;), we entered into the Gilead Collaboration Agreement to discover and develop specific inhibitors of TGF&#946; activation focused on the treatment of fibrotic diseases.

These patent families are directed to methods for modulating the activation of the TGF&#946;&#160;superfamily of growth factors and methods for screening for a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets an inactive form of the growth factor, thereby preventing activation (e.g., release) of mature growth factor. The TGF&#946;&#160;superfamily is a group of more than 30 related growth factors/cytokines that mediate diverse biological processes and includes TGF&#946;1 and myostatin (also known as GDF-8). Issued U.S. patents in the platform families include: U.S. Patents Nos.&#160;<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">9,573,995 (issued 02/21/2017); 9,758,576 (issued 09/12/2017); 9,580,500 (issued 02/28/2017); 9,399,676 (issued 07/26/2016), 9,758,577 (issued 09/12/2017) and 10,597,443 (issued 03/24/2020).

Patent prosecution of these pending patent families is ongoing but relatively early. </p><p style="background-color:#ffffff;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-bottom:14pt;margin:0pt;">Two families are directed to composition of matter claims that cover our proprietary antibodies. PCT/US2015/059468 (published as WO 2016/073853) broadly covers a class of monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind inactive precursors thereby preventing activation of myostatin. This patent family is projected to expire in November 2035. U.S. Patent 10,307,480 has issued in June 2019, with issued claims directed to Scholar Rock proprietary antibodies that specifically bine pro/latent myostatin, including 29H4, the parental clone of apitegromab<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">, and variants.  A second family, PCT/US2016/052014 (published as WO 2017/049011), discloses the specific amino acid sequence of </span>apitegromab<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> and is projected to expire in September 2036. Patent 10,751,413 issued in August 2020, with claims directed to antibodies and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the heavy and light chain sequences of apitegromab. The European application has also been found allowable, with an Intention to Grant issued by the European Patent Office (EPO).  The allowable claims relate to antibodies comprising the heavy and light chain variable region sequences of apitegromab, and pharmaceutical compositions of the antibodies.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-bottom:14pt;margin:0pt;">The following three patent families are directed to therapeutic uses/methods:</p><p style="background-color:#ffffff;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-bottom:14pt;margin:0pt;">PCT/US2017/012606 (published as WO 2017/120523) broadly covers treatment methods for a number of muscle and neuromuscular disease and disorders using an antibody that specifically blocks the activation step of myostatin. The related U.S. application was issued in May 2019 as U.S. Patent 10,287,345 and is projected to expire in September 2036. The issued claims are drawn to methods for inhibiting myostatin activation using our proprietary activation inhibitors (such as apitegromab<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">) to cause specified pharmacological effects to treat a variety of conditions including, muscle and metabolic disorders. A second U.S. application issued as U.S. Patent 10,882,904 in January 2021.  The issued claims recite methods for inhibiting myostatin activation using an antibody comprising the heavy and light chain sequences of apitegromab for various indications.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-bottom:14pt;margin:0pt;">PCT/US2017/037332 (published as WO 2017/218592) is directed to methods for treating neuromuscular diseases and selecting patient populations that are likely to respond to myostatin inhibition. This filing includes the treatment of SMA in patients who are on an SMN corrector therapy (e.g., SMN upregulators). This patent family is projected to expire in June 2037. <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The PCT application was nationalized in 11 jurisdictions, and the applications in the three key jurisdictions (i.e., U.S., Europe and Japan) have recently either been allowed or granted. Specifically, the U.S. application, serial number 16/308,007 was recently found allowable. The allowed claims are directed to add-on or combination therapy for treating spinal muscular atrophy with a myostatin inhibitor and a neuronal corrector (such as smn upregulator therapy).  Similar claims are also granted in Japan (JP Patent No. 6823167).  Likewise, the European counterpart has granted as EP 3368069B1, and has been validated in 37 states. The granted European claims are directed to add-on therapy and combination therapy for the treatment of SMA using a myostatin-selective inhibitor, in conjunction with an SMN corrector therapy.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-bottom:14pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">PCT/US2018/012686 (published as WO 2018/129395) relates to the treatment of metabolic diseases with a myostatin activation inhibitor and is projected to expire in January 2038.

In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20&#160;years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14&#160;years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic or provide an additional period of protection for the approved pharmaceutical product following expiry of the patent. In the future, if our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the U.S. and the national patent offices in Europe, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.</p><p style="background-color:#ffffff;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates and research programs, we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. For example, certain elements of our proprietary platform may be based on unpatented trade secrets that are not publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party&#39;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations, and our advice for best practices, in protecting our trade secrets.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Manufacturing</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We do not own or operate facilities for clinical drug manufacturing, storage, distribution or quality testing. Currently, all of our clinical manufacturing is outsourced to third-party manufacturers. As our development programs expand and we build new process efficiencies, we expect to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for registration trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale and distribution of commercial products.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Antibody Discovery</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have built and internalized antibody display and discovery capability, however at times we may continue to rely on third parties to conduct antibody discovery and optimization based on criteria and specifications provided by us. Certain antibody discovery and optimization vendors require us to enter into a license with them for the right to use antibodies discovered by them in humans or for commercial purposes. Such license could include substantial milestone payments and royalties to the extent we choose to use an antibody discovered by such vendor. On March 12, 2019, we exercised an option to receive such a license from Adimab pursuant to our Adimab Agreement.

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30&#160;days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold.

Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">FDA Review Process</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product&#8217;s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the U.S.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">41</p></div></div>

The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60&#160;days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file (&#8220;RTF&#8221;) by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10&#160;months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an Approval Letter or a Complete Response Letter. An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase&#160;3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Orphan Drug Designation</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In March 2018, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for apitegromab for the treatment of SMA. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication.

If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Rare Pediatric Disease Designation</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation for apitegromab for the treatment of SMA in August 2020. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The FDA grants Rare Pediatric Disease designation for serious and life-threatening diseases that primarily affect children ages 18 years or younger and fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a biologics license application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) for apitegromab for the treatment of SMA is approved by the FDA, Scholar Rock may be eligible to receive a priority review voucher, which may be redeemed to obtain priority review for any subsequent marketing application or be sold or transferred.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Expedited Development and Review Programs</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for Fast Track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (&#8220;IMM&#8221;), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. If the FDA determines that the conditions of approval are not being met, the FDA can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as Fast Track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Pediatric Information</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (&#8220;PREA&#8221;), as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">43</p></div></div>

The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (&#8220;PSP&#8221;) within 60&#160;days of an end-of-Phase&#160;2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase&#160;3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Post-marketing Requirements</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue.  Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">44</p></div></div>

Such data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, in California the California Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the current version of the CCPA, other personal information may be applicable and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope.

We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The ACA, for example, contains provisions that subject biological products to potential competition by lower cost biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part&#160;D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal health care programs. The Trump Administration and Congress have taken steps to make administrative or legislative changes, including modification, repeal, or replacement of all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which may impact reimbursement for drugs and biologics. On January&#160;20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October&#160;13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October&#160;25, 2017. On June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued the payments were owed to them. This was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments on December 10, 2019. We cannot predict how the U.S. Supreme Court will rule. In addition, the CMS finalized regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Further, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Reform Act includes a provision, effective January&#160;1, 2019, decreasing the tax based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the &#8220;individual mandate,&#8221; to $0. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#8220;Tax Act&#8221;), the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect the latest ruling will have on the status of the ACA. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (&#8220;BBA&#8221;), among other things, amends the ACA, effective January&#160;1, 2019, to increase from 50&#160;percent to 70&#160;percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part&#160;D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the &#8220;donut hole.&#8221; In December 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">47</p></div></div>

These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken.</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:36pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:36pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that the CMS, reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by 2% in 2013, which served as a base for 2014 and subsequent years.

The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;"> permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. We expect that additional foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.</span></td></tr></table><div style="margin-top:12pt;"></div><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration released a &#8220;Blueprint&#8221; that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS&#8217;s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019.

For example, the U.S. government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs. Additionally, the Trump Administration&#8217;s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 and 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part&#160;D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part&#160;B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. On September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Action of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019, and would require the HHS to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. The Lower Drugs Costs Now Act of 2019 has passed out of the House and was delivered to the Senate on December 16, 2019. However, it is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Packaging and Distribution in the U.S.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.

The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14&#160;years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (&#8220;BPCI Act&#8221;). This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">A reference biological product is granted 12&#160;years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. &#8220;First licensure&#8221; typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the U.S. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">50</p></div></div>

This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a trial.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">European Union Drug Development</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">In the EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU&#160;Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU&#160;clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU&#160;Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU&#160;countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (&#8220;NCA&#8221;), and one or more Ethics Committees (&#8220;ECs&#8221;). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation&#160;EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">European Union Drug Marketing</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the U.S., the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician&#8217;s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">European Union Drug Review and Approval</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (&#8220;MA&#8221;). There are two types of marketing authorizations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Community MA is issued by the EC through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (&#8220;CHMP&#8221;), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicines such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">51</p></div></div>

Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (&#8220;RMS&#8221;). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (&#8220;SPC&#8221;), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e.,&#160;in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">European Union Exclusivity</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11&#160;years if, during the first eight years of those 10&#160;years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">In the EU, the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (&#8220;COMP&#8221;), grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). In December 2018, the EC granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10&#160;years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">European Data Collection and State Privacy Laws</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Since we conduct clinical trials in the EEA, we are subject to additional European data privacy laws. The General Data Protection Regulation, (EU) 2016/679 (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), became effective on May 25, 2018, and deals with the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal data (such as health and other sensitive data,) relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the EEA, including to the U.S., providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information, responding to individuals&#8217; requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information, reporting security breaches involving personal data to the </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">52</p></div></div>

The GDPR increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of our total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Given the limited enforcement of the GDPR to date, we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on our trials and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">National laws of member states of the EU are in the process of being adapted to the requirements under the GDPR, thereby implementing national laws which may partially deviate from the GDPR and impose different obligations from country to country, so that we do not expect to operate in a uniform legal landscape in the EEA. Also, as it relates to processing and transfer of genetic data, the GDPR specifically allows national laws to impose additional and more specific requirements or restrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional uncertainty. Further, the impact of the impending &#8220;Brexit&#8221;, (whereby the United Kingdom is planning to leave the EEA in March of 2019), either with or without a &quot;deal&quot; is uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In the event we continue to conduct clinical trials in the EEA, we must also ensure that we maintain adequate safeguards to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA, in particular to the U.S., in compliance with European data protection laws. We expect that we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by a European data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by European data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products and solutions due to the potential risk exposure as a result of the current (and, in particular, future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical partners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition, California recently enacted the CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020.  While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted.  The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Rest of the World Regulation</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">For other countries outside of the EU and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA&#8217;s accounting provisions.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Reimbursement</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products, if approved, will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurers and managed healthcare organizations, as well as the level of reimbursement such third-party payors provide for our products. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a return on our investment. In the U.S. no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs or biological products exists, and one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process may be a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients.

The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the &#8220;MMA&#8221;) established the Medicare Part&#160;D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part&#160;D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part&#160;A and B, Part&#160;D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part&#160;D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part&#160;D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part&#160;D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part&#160;D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part&#160;D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part&#160;D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part&#160;B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#8217;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low priced and high priced member states, can further reduce prices. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">55</p></div></div>

In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Human Capital</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Scholar Rock employees are relentlessly focused on seeing new possibilities in deep structural insights, validated biologies, and antibody technologies to discover and develop a pipeline of innovative new medicines.

We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, including the development and deployment of any vaccine program. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, including our clinical trials, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions that have impacted our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access and monitor certain clinical trial sites, restrictions on clinical trial participants&#8217; ability to access our clinical trial sites and delays in enrollment. Some clinical trial participants have missed or experienced delays in receiving doses of study drug and completing their clinical trial assessments. For example, three patients (one in Cohort 2 and two in Cohort 3) of the TOPAZ clinical trial each missed three doses of apitegromab and the six-month interim analysis timepoint due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions; the six-month timepoint from these patients was not included in the interim analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our clinical trials and could result in further impacts, including delays in or adverse impacts to data readouts (e.g. poor or negative efficacy results or adverse safety signal) from our clinical trials, delays in our ability to identify and enroll patients in current or future clinical trials and decisions by enrolled patients to discontinue from our clinical trials due to COVID-19 related concerns.  Additionally, our laboratory operations have been reduced since the declaration of the pandemic and our research activities will continue to be impacted until our laboratory operations are able to return to normal levels of operation that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, delays in the development of COVID-19 vaccines or the deployment of approved vaccines, a recurrence or &#8220;subsequent waves&#8221; of COVID-19 cases, or the discovery of vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants could cause other widespread or more severe impacts. We continue to monitor developments as we deal with the disruptions and uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Facilities</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Our corporate headquarters and operations are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In March 2015, we entered into a lease of laboratory and office space at 620 Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Further, the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials. For example, we anticipate some of our future trials to, in part, utilize an open-label trial design, and our ongoing DRAGON Phase 1 clinical trial for SRK-181 in cancer immunotherapy and our ongoing TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial for apitegromab in Type 2 and Type 3 SMA, in part, utilize an open-label trial design. An open-label trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the test article or either an existing approved drug or placebo. Open-label trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label studies are aware that they are receiving treatment. Open-label trials may be subject to a patient bias, for example if patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. Open-label trials also may be subject to an investigator bias where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The potential sources of bias in clinical trials as a result of open-label design may not be adequately mitigated and may cause any of our trials that utilize such design to fail and additional trials may be necessary to support future marketing applications.  In addition, other types of trials (including randomized, double-blind, parallel arm studies), particularly if smaller in size or if limited to one study, are also subject to potential sources of bias and limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect or falsely identify a positive efficacy signal</span>, <span style="font-weight:normal;">or conversely, fail to detect an efficacy signal when in fact there may actually be a positive therapeutic effect.</span> <span style="font-weight:normal;"> Further, the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in clinical testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, potentially impairing our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harming our business and results of operations.

These measures have had and continue to have a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees are continuing their work remotely outside of our offices. Additionally, our laboratory operations have been reduced since the declaration of the pandemic and our research activities will continue to be impacted until our laboratory operations are able to return to normal levels of operation that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We rely on third party manufacturers to manufacture apitegromab and SRK-181. Two vaccines for COVID-19 coronavirus were granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA in late 2020, and more are likely to be authorized in the coming months. The resultant demand for vaccines and potential for manufacturing facilities and materials to be commandeered under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or equivalent foreign legislation, may make it more difficult to obtain materials or manufacturing slots for the drug substance needed for apitegromab or SRK-181. If any of our third party manufacturers is adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or if they divert resources or manufacturing capacity to accommodate the development or manufacture of a COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to supply apitegromab or SRK-181 for our clinical trials. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions that impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">62</p></div></div>

Disruptions and delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional impacts upon our clinical trials, including delays in or adverse impacts to data readouts (e.g. poor or negative efficacy results or adverse safety signal) from our clinical trials and delays in our ability to identify and enroll patients in current or future clinical trials. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">63</p></div></div>

Certain patients in our TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial are receiving apitegromab in conjunction with an approved SMN upregulator therapy such as nusinersen.  These patients are reliant on the continued use and availability of such therapies. If access to an approved SMN upregulator therapy such as nusinersen becomes limited or is unavailable, we may be forced to pause or stop our TOPAZ trial, or the medical condition of patients may be affected which could negatively affect the efficacy and safety results for apitegromab in the trial.  We have also initiated the DRAGON Phase 1 clinical trial of SRK-181 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies.  Certain patients in this clinical trial will receive SRK-181 in conjunction with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy such as pembrolizumab.  If access to the approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy becomes limited or is unavailable, we may not be able to enroll, or may be delayed in enrolling patients or may be forced to pause or stop our DRAGON Phase 1 clinical trial, or the medical condition of patients may be affected which could negatively affect the efficacy and safety results for SRK-181 in the trial.

Preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials are primarily designed to study PK and PD, understand the side effects of product candidates, and evaluate various doses and dosing schedules.  Our current or future product candidates may demonstrate different chemical, biological and pharmacological properties in patients than they do in laboratory studies or may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen or harmful ways. Product candidates in later-stages of clinical trials may fail to show desired pharmacological properties or produce positive safety and efficacy results despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials.  We completed a Phase 1 trial for apitegromab in healthy adult volunteers and apitegromab is currently being evaluated in the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA.  In October 2020, the Company announced positive six-month interim analysis results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial. We also initiated the DRAGON Phase 1 trial for SRK-181 in cancer immunotherapy. We cannot assure you that the DRAGON Phase 1 trial, TOPAZ Phase 2 trial, or any other future clinical trials of SRK-181 or apitegromab, will show positive results. There can be no assurance that any of our current or future clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our product candidates. There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologics proceeding through clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical development even after achieving promising results in earlier studies, and any such setbacks in our clinical development could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Interim and preliminary results from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to additional audit, validation and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">From time to time, we may publish interim data, including interim top-line results or preliminary results from our clinical trials.

As a result, interim and preliminary data may not be predictive of final results and should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. We may also arrive at different conclusions, or considerations may qualify such results, once we have received and fully evaluated additional data. For example, in October 2020, we announced data from the 6-month interim analysis of our TOPAZ trial of apitegromab. We believe these interim data support further evaluation of apitegromab in a registrational clinical trial, subject to consultation with the FDA and other regulatory agencies.

Additionally, the orphan designation requires that there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Any orphan drug designation that we are granted for our product candidates in the U.S. or in the EU would not assure orphan drug designation of those product candidates in any other jurisdiction.

In addition, if a product candidate receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity for that indication. Orphan drug exclusivity means the FDA may not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to scientific assistance regarding necessary tests and trials, financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following grant of marketing authorization for the medicinal product if the criteria for orphan designation continue to be met before the grant of the marketing authorization. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We have received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for apitegromab for the treatment of SMA, and following the EMA&#8217;s COMP&#8217;s positive opinion, the EC designated apitegromab as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of SMA. Even if we receive orphan drug exclusivity, the benefit of that exclusivity may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or could be revoked under certain circumstances, for example if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or that we are unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even if we receive orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition during the exclusivity period because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition, and the same product can be approved for different uses. Also, in the U.S., even after an orphan drug is approved and receives orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA may subsequently approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the latter drug is not the same drug, including because it has been shown to be clinically superior to the drug with exclusivity because it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.

The FDA may determine that a BLA for apitegromab, if approved, does not meet the eligibility criteria for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, including for the following reasons:</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">SMA no longer meets the definition of a rare pediatric disease;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">apitegromab contains an active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been previously approved in an application;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">the BLA is not deemed eligible for priority review;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">the BLA does not rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population and dosages of the drug intended for that population; or</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">the BLA seeks approval for a different adult indication than the rare pediatric disease for which apitegromab is designated.</span></td></tr></table><div style="margin-top:10pt;"></div><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The authority for the FDA to award rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers for biologics after September 30, 2024 is currently limited to biologics that receive rare pediatric disease designation on or prior to September 30, 2024, and the FDA may only award rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers through September 30, 2026.

Products that have been designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for more frequent interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor, which can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development, as well as rolling review.

The commencement and rate of completion of preclinical studies for a product candidate may be delayed by many factors, including, for example, challenges in reaching consensus with regulatory agencies regarding the scope of the necessary preclinical study program and/or appropriate preclinical study designs.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Risk Related to Manufacturing and Supply</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Because we rely on third-party manufacturing and supply partners, our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development materials, and, if approved, commercial materials, may become limited or interrupted or may not be of satisfactory quantity or quality.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture some of our preclinical product candidate supplies and rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture all of our clinical trial product supplies and, if approved, will rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture all of our commercial product supplies, including all of our drug substance, vialing, labeling, and packaging. We do not own manufacturing facilities for producing any clinical trial or commercial product supplies. There can be no assurance that our preclinical, clinical development, and, if approved, commercial product supplies will not be limited or interrupted, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or that our product supplies will be of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices.

Suppliers and manufacturers must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory authorities in order to comply with regulatory standards, such as cGMP. In the event that any of our manufacturers fails to comply with such requirements or to perform its obligations to us in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, such as due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we currently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with another third-party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty transferring such skills or technology to another third-party and a feasible alternative may not exist. These factors would increase our reliance on the original manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have another third-party manufacture our product candidates. If we must change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. We will also need to verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product candidate according to the specifications previously submitted to the FDA or another regulatory authority.

For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (&#8220;ACA&#8221;) was enacted, which, among other things, has substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and has significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, expands healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, establishes new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% as of January 1, 2019, pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018) point of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability, expands the entities eligible for discounts under the PHS Act&#8217;s pharmaceutical pricing program, also known as the 340B Drug Pricing Program, creates new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, creates a new requirement to annually report </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">77</p></div></div>

Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (&#8220;Tax Act&#8221;), includes a provision that decreased the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, commonly referred to as the &#8220;individual mandate,&#8221; to $0, effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. Pending a decision, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect these developments will have on the status of the ACA.  On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA -mandated fees, including the so-called &#8220;Cadillac&#8221; tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices; however, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (&#8220;BBA&#8221;), among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the &#8220;donut hole&#8221;.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. For example, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Selection Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction, which triggered the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. In concert with subsequent legislation, this includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year through 2030.</span> <span style="font-weight:normal;">However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economy Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;), and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions will be suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also reduced Medicare payments to several types of health care providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years, among other things.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration&#8217;s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent &#8220;principles&#8221; for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the Trump administration also previously released a &#8220;Blueprint&#8221;, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">78</p></div></div>
<div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;page-break-after:always;width:79.3%;border:0;margin:30pt 10.35% 30pt 10.35%;"></div><div style="max-width:100%;padding-left:10.35%;padding-right:10.35%;position:relative;"><div style="margin-top:21.6pt;min-height:41.75pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"><a href="#TOC"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">Table of Contents</span></a></p></div><div style="clear:both;max-width:100%;position:relative;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS&#8217;s policy change that became effective January 1, 2019. In addition, there has been several changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. On December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a reimbursement formula change under the 340B drug pricing program, and CMS subsequently altered the FYs 2019 and 2018 reimbursement formula on specified covered outpatient drugs (&#8220;SCODs&#8221;). The court ruled this change was not an &#8220;adjustment&#8221; which was within the Secretary&#8217;s discretion to make but was instead a fundamental change in the reimbursement calculation. However, most recently, on July 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the district court&#8217;s decision and found that the changes were within the Secretary&#8217;s authority. On September 14, 2020, the plaintiffs-appellees filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc (i.e., before the full court), but was denied on October 16, 2020. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any. While a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (&#8220;Right to Try Act&#8221;), was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval.  There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">These laws, and state and federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare or other healthcare funding or otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Our relationships with healthcare providers and physicians and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufacturers to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which such companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In particular, the research of our product candidates, as well as the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information received in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials.

Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time and resource consuming and can divert a company&#8217;s attention from the business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition, there has been a trend of increased state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing.

If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical manufacturer to incur significant legal expenses and divert management&#8217;s attention from the operation of the business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect business in an adverse way.</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">81</p></div></div>

In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our CROs and collaborators. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by HITECH. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Compliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals&#8217; privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We conduct our TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial of apitegromab in the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;), may conduct future clinical trials in the EEA and therefore may be subject to additional privacy laws. The General Data Protection Regulation, (EU) 2016/679 (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) became effective on May 25, 2018, and deals with the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal information relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the EEA, including to the U.S., providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information, responding to individuals&#8217; requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information, reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments, and record-keeping. The GDPR increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of our total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Given the new law, we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. Following the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020 and the end of the transitional arrangements agreed between the U.K. and EU as of January 1, 2021, the GDPR has been incorporated into </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">82</p></div></div>

Also, as it relates to processing and transfer of genetic data, the GDPR specifically allows national laws to impose additional and more specific requirements or restrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional uncertainty. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">In the conduct of our current or future clinical trials in the EEA, we must also ensure that we maintain adequate safeguards to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA, in particular to the U.S., in compliance with European data protection laws. We expect that we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by a European data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by European data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products and solutions due to the potential risk exposure as a result of the current (and, in particular, future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical partners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition, California recently enacted the CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General has commenced bringing enforcement actions against violators as of July 1, 2020.  While there are currently exceptions for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. We continue to monitor the impact the CCPA may have on our business activities.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Additional laws and regulations governing international operations, including certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, could negatively impact or restrict our operations.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">If we further expand our operations outside of the U.S., we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">83</p></div></div>

Our research and development activities involve the use of biological and hazardous materials and produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Although we maintain workers&#8217; compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.

For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources.

On March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities and provided guidance regarding the conduct of clinical trials which the FDA continues to update. As of June 23, 2020, the FDA noted it was continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. As of July 2020, the FDA is utilizing a rating system to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct such inspections based on data about the virus&#8217; trajectory in a given state and locality and the rules and guidelines that are put in place by state and local governments. The FDA is either continuing to, on a case-by-case basis, conduct only mission critical inspections, or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include pre-approval inspections. On November 23, 2020, the FDA Commissioner reiterated that the agency has </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">85</p></div></div>

The FDA may not be able to maintain this pace and delays or setbacks are possible in the future. Should FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter.  The FDA issued a guidance document in December 2020 setting forth review timelines for applicant responses to complete response letters received because a facility inspection is required prior to approval. Further, if there is inadequate information to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility, FDA may defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. In 2020, several companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA&#39;s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. Additionally, regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities. If a prolonged government shutdown or other disruption occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future shutdowns or other disruptions could also affect other government agencies such as the SEC, which may also impact our business by delaying review of our public filings, to the extent such review is necessary, and our ability to access the public markets.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Our current operations are concentrated in one location, and we or the third parties upon whom we depend may experience business interruptions and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster, including earthquakes, outbreak of disease or other natural disasters.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Our office and laboratory facilities are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or manmade accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, the facilities at any clinical trial site, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of apitegromab, SRK-181 and future product candidates or interruption of our business operations. If a natural disaster, outbreak of disease, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our research facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has already resulted in extended shutdowns of certain businesses and has had ripple effects to businesses around the world. This virus continues to spread globally and, as of March 2021, has spread to a number of countries, including the U.S. where cases continue to rise in certain states. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. In response to the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, most of our employees are continuing their work remotely outside of our offices. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to identify and enroll patients in current and future clinical trials may become more difficult and costly and data readouts from our clinical trials may be delayed or adversely impacted. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business or operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 coronavirus and the actions to contain the COVID-19 coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.

As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products on a payor by payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of product candidates. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our product candidates.

We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, cost containment initiatives and additional legislative changes. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or will be losing employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One payor&#8217;s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive evidence generation studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such a product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to current standards of care, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to cover its costs or make a profit. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">EU drug marketing and reimbursement regulations may materially affect our ability to market and receive coverage for our products in the European member states.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions.

In some foreign countries, particularly those in the EU, the pricing of medicinal products is subject to governmental control and other market regulations which could put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receiving marketing approval of a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Much like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the U.S., the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU.

The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues from sales by us or our strategic partners and the potential profitability of any of our product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">The failure to maintain the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, or the failure of Gilead to perform its obligations under or our failure to achieve certain milestones under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">On December 19, 2018, we entered into the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, to discover and develop specific inhibitors of TGF&#946; activation focused on the treatment of fibrotic diseases. Under the collaboration, Gilead has exclusive options to license worldwide rights to product candidates that emerge from three of our TGF&#946; programs (each a &#8220;Gilead Program&#8221;). Pursuant to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for antibody discovery and preclinical research through product candidate nomination, after which, upon exercising the option for a Gilead Program, Gilead will be responsible for the Gilead Program&#8217;s preclinical and clinical development and commercialization. In consideration of the foregoing, we received $80 million in upfront payments, comprised of $50 million in cash and a $30 million equity investment in us. In addition, in January 2020, we received a one-time milestone payment of $25.0 million for the successful demonstration of efficacy in preclinical in vivo proof-of-concept studies and will be eligible to receive up to an additional $1,425 million in potential payments aggregated across all three Gilead Programs, based on the successful achievement of certain research, development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. We would also receive high single-digit to low double-digit tiered royalties on sales of potential future products originating from the collaboration. We cannot guarantee the outcome of our efforts to achieve such milestones, and, even if we achieve such milestones, we cannot directly control Gilead&#8217;s performance of its obligations under the agreement or the amount and timing of resources that Gilead will dedicate to these efforts, and accordingly, we may not receive any additional milestone or royalty payments that are contingent upon our or Gilead&#8217;s achievements. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We are subject to a number of other risks associated with our collaboration with Gilead, including:</span></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">If we are able to identify program antibodies and present Gilead with development candidate nominations, Gilead may not exercise its option to such program or we and Gilead could disagree as to future development plans, and Gilead may delay, fail to commence, or stop future preclinical and clinical development and commercialization.</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">If Gilead exercised one or more options, following such exercise, Gilead will have sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of the product candidates from such program in the applicable field.

In order for us to successfully partner our product candidates, potential partners must view these product candidates as economically valuable in markets they determine to be attractive in light of the terms that we are seeking and other available products for licensing by other companies. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator&#8217;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator&#8217;s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations or do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates, bring them to market and generate revenue from sales of drugs or continue to develop our technology, and our business may be materially and adversely affected. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish new strategic collaborations, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such strategic collaborations if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product are disappointing. Any delay in entering into new strategic collaboration agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property.

If we are unable to secure and maintain patent protection for any product or technology we develop, or if the scope of the patent protection secured is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to commercialize any product candidates we may develop may be adversely affected. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The patenting process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all relevant markets. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and are reliant on our licensors or licensees. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the U.S. and/or in other foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">92</p></div></div>

Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property and/or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We cannot be certain that we are the first to invent the inventions covered by pending patent applications and, if we are not, we may be subject to priority disputes. We may be required to disclaim part or all of the term of certain patents or all of the term of certain patent applications. There may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim. There also may be prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim. No assurance can be given that if challenged, our patents would be declared by a court to be valid or enforceable or that even if found valid and enforceable, a competitor&#8217;s technology or product would be found by a court to infringe our patents. We may analyze patents or patent applications of our competitors that we believe are relevant to our activities, and consider that we are free to operate in relation to our product candidates, but our competitors may achieve issued claims, including in patents we consider to be unrelated, which block our efforts or may potentially result in our product candidates or our activities infringing such claims. The possibility exists that others will develop products which have the same effect as our products on an independent basis which do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property rights, or will design around the claims of patents that we have had issued that cover our products. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition, periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent application process and following the issuance of a patent. While an inadvertent lapse can, in many cases, be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. Moreover, complications due to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in inadvertent lapse due to, for example, unexpected closures of the USPTO or foreign patent offices, delays in delivery of notifications relating to deadlines, or failure to timely and/or properly obtain signatures on necessary documents.  In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.

In certain cases, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution&#8217;s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to others, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property or to maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of such program and our business and financial condition could suffer.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and companies, which may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete such negotiations and ultimately acquire the rights to the intellectual property surrounding the additional product candidates that we may seek to acquire.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Changes in patent law in the U.S. and in ex U.S. jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition, recent or future patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. Under the enacted Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the &#8220;America Invents Act&#8221;), enacted in 2013, the U.S. moved from a &#8220;first to invent&#8221; to a &#8220;first to file&#8221; system. Under a &#8220;first to file&#8221; system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The America Invents Act includes a number of other significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and establish a new post-grant review system. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO only recently developed new regulations and procedures in connection with the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law, including the &#8220;first to file&#8221; provisions, only became effective in March 2013. In addition, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have also narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised eligibility and validity standards.  </span> <span style="font-weight:normal;">Additionally, some of our owned or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in proceedings before the USPTO, or during litigation, under the revised criteria which could also make it more difficult to obtain patents.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the case Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi, the Federal Circuit held that a well characterized antigen is insufficient to satisfy the written description requirement of certain claims directed to a genus of antibodies that are solely defined by function. While the validity of a subset of patents at issue was subsequently upheld by a district court jury, uncertainty remains as to the legal question pertaining </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">96</p></div></div>

There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation, inter partes review, post-grant review, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of drugs, products or their methods of use or manufacture. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates, technologies or methods.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">If a third-party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:</span></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management&#8217;s attention from our core business;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product candidate or technology at issue infringes on or violates the third-party&#8217;s rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner&#8217;s attorneys&#8217; fees;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">a court prohibiting us from developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling our product candidates, or from using our proprietary technologies, unless the third-party licenses its product rights to us, which it is not required to do;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">if a license is available from a third-party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees and other amounts, and/or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products; and</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;">redesigning our product candidates or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.</span></td></tr></table><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.

In this regard, patents issued in the U.S. by law enjoy a presumption of validity that can be rebutted only with evidence that is &#8220;clear and convincing,&#8221; a heightened standard of proof. There may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of our product candidates, constructs or molecules used in or formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our ability to commercialize our product candidates may be impaired or delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business. Even if we obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Parties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, and/or pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We may also choose to challenge the patentability of claims in a third-party&#8217;s U.S. patent by requesting that the USPTO review the patent claims in an ex-parte re-exam, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings.

If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In some situations, we or our licensor, may not be able to detect infringement against our owned or in-licensed patents, as the case may be, which may be especially difficult for manufacturing processes or formulation patents. Even if we or our licensors detect infringement by a third-party of our owned or in-licensed patents, we or our licensors, as the case may be, may choose not to pursue litigation against or settlement with the third-party. If we, or our licensors, later sue such third-party for patent infringement, the third-party may have certain legal defenses available to it, which otherwise would not be available except for the delay between when the infringement was first detected and when the suit was brought. Such legal defenses may make it impossible for us or our licensors to enforce our owned or in-licensed patents, as the case may be, against such third-party.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Issued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or the USPTO.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third-party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the U.S. or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include inter parties review, ex parte re-examination, post-grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings are expensive and could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our rights, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In addition, because some patent applications in the U.S. may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in PCT member jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the earliest filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our owned and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications, or that we or, if applicable, a licensor were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our products, compositions, methods of use, or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our owned and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned by or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. If we or one of our licensors is a party to an interference proceeding involving a U.S. patent application on inventions owned by or in-licensed to us, we may incur substantial costs, divert management&#8217;s time and expend other resources, even if we are successful.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">For applications filed under pre-AIA, interference proceedings declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors.

Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.

Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products and/or methods of medical treatment, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products against third parties in violation of our proprietary rights generally. The initiation of proceedings by third parties to challenge the scope or validity of our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Patent terms may result in inadequate protection for our product candidates, and we may be unable to obtain patent term extensions and data exclusivity for our product candidates, resulting in material harm to our business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions such as patent term adjustments and/or extensions, may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Action of 1984, also known as the Hatch Waxman Amendments. The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the BLA, plus the time between the date of submission of the BLA and the date of FDA approval of the product.  The patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">100</p></div></div>

If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration.  As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition to patent protection, we rely heavily upon know-how and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third-party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. If we choose to go to court to stop a third-party from using any of our trade secrets, we may incur substantial costs. These lawsuits may consume our time and other resources even if we are successful. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations, and our advice for best practices, in protecting our trade secrets.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Third parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used, disclosed, or misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors.

In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and, if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. This type of litigation or proceeding could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources.

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $341.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Our monthly spending levels will vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities.

In addition, any debt financing may subject us to fixed payment obligations and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We also could be required to seek collaborators for apitegromab, SRK-181 or any future product candidate at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or relinquish our rights to product candidates or technologies that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.

In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future.

As of December 31, 2020, we also had available tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $15.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2034 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited to 80% of our taxable income in any future taxable year. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), changes in our ownership may limit the amount of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually to offset our future taxable income, if any. This limitation would generally apply in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Any such limitation may significantly reduce our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards before they expire. Private placements and other transactions that have occurred since our inception, as well as our initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;), may trigger such an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Code. Any such limitation, whether as the result of our IPO, prior private placements, sales of our common stock by our existing stockholders or additional sales of our common stock by us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future years. </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">104</p></div></div>

Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management will be required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually.

Our novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled us to develop a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors. By targeting the signaling proteins at the cellular level and acting in the disease microenvironment, we believe we may avoid the historical dose-limiting safety challenges associated with inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect. We believe our focus on biologically validated growth factors may facilitate a more efficient development path. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We have a productive scientific platform and are building our portfolio of novel product candidates with the aim of transforming the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, and fibrosis.

Apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-directed therapy for the treatment of SMA. Our TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial enrolled 58 patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA across three cohorts; one patient discontinued from the trial. On October 27, 2020 we announced positive six-month interim analysis results from the TOPAZ trial and top-line data for the 12-month treatment period are expected in the second quarter of 2021. The FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation and Orphan Drug Designation to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA in August 2020 and March 2018, respectively. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Our second product candidate, SRK-181, is being developed for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to CPI therapies, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody therapies. SRK-181 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent TGF&#946;1. In May 2020, we announced the initiation of patient dosing in our DRAGON Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial of SRK-181 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies. This two-part trial consists of a dose escalation portion (Part A) and a dose expansion portion (Part B).

We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, including the development and deployment of any vaccine program. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, including our clinical trials, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions that have impacted our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access and monitor certain clinical trial sites, restrictions on clinical trial participants&#8217; ability to access our clinical trial sites and delays in enrollment. Some clinical trial participants have missed or experienced delays in receiving doses of study drug and completing their clinical trial assessments. For example, three patients (one in Cohort 2 and two in Cohort 3) of the TOPAZ clinical trial each missed three doses of apitegromab and the six-month interim analysis timepoint due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions; the six-month timepoint from these patients was not included in the interim analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our clinical trials and could result in further impacts, including delays in or adverse impacts to data readouts (e.g. poor or negative efficacy results or adverse safety signal) from our clinical trials, delays in our ability to identify and enroll patients in current or future clinical trials and decisions by enrolled patients to discontinue from our clinical trials due to COVID-19 related concerns. Additionally, our laboratory operations have been reduced since the declaration of the pandemic and our research activities will continue to be impacted until our laboratory operations are able to return to normal levels of operation that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The input method is based on the costs incurred on each Gilead Program and the costs expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy the performance obligation. The transfer of control occurs over time. In management&#8217;s judgment, this input method is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligations. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The estimate of remaining costs is highly subjective, as the research is novel, therefore efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs made at the balance sheet date. The amounts received that have not yet been recognized as revenue are recorded in deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet.

Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development goods and services to be received in the future from third parties are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related services are performed.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">A significant portion of our research and development costs have been external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis after a clinical product candidate has been identified. However, we do not allocate our internal research and development expenses, consisting primarily of employee related costs, depreciation and other indirect costs, on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials, as well as the associated clinical trial material requirements. We expect research and development costs to increase for the foreseeable future as our product candidate development programs progress, and we expect to incur additional costs in connection with our research and development activities under our collaboration with Gilead. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The successful development of apitegromab, SRK-181 and any future product candidates is uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of apitegromab, SRK-181 and any future product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of our product candidates, if approved. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of:</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New

A $25.0 million preclinical milestone was achieved in December 2019 through the successful demonstration of efficacy in preclinical <i style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</i> proof-of-concept studies.

In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many&#160;years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, common stockholder ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of a common stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.  Market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed.  If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">This management&#8217;s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">120</p></div></div>

This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. In certain instances, we prepay for services to be provided in the future. These amounts are expensed as the services are performed.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid balance accordingly. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts incurred. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Determination of the Fair Value of Equity-Based Awards</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We determine the fair value of restricted common stock awards granted based on the fair value of our common stock less any purchase price, as applicable. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and subjective assumptions we make, including the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of the award. Due to the lack of a public market for the trading of our common stock prior to our IPO, and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we base the estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. The historical volatility is generally calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We use the simplified method to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees and directors. We utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For grants to non-employees, ASU 2018-07 allows entities to use the expected term to measure non-employee options or elect to use the contractual term as the expected term, on an award-by-award basis. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management&#39;s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we used significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">121</p></div></div>

Revenue generation activities have been limited to collaborations, containing research services and the issuance of a license. Currently, revenue is being recognized related to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement which was executed in December 2018. We began recognizing associated revenue in 2019 over the period that research is performed under the collaboration. We account for revenue under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii) measurement of the transaction price, (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to our customer.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Identification of the Contract(s) with the Customer</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We account for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of ASC 606 when all of the following criteria are met: (i) the arrangement has been approved by the parties and the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, (ii) each party&#39;s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iii) the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iv) the arrangement has commercial substance and (v) collection of substantially all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer is probable.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Identification of the Performance Obligations</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, we consider factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of our customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer&#8217;s discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying license relative to the option exercise price, including assumptions about technical feasibility and the probability of developing a candidate that would be subject to the option rights.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Determination of the Transaction Price</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We estimate the transaction price based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. We utilize either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">We evaluate whether development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">122</p></div></div>

Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee&#39;s control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenue and earnings in the period of adjustment. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">For sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, we determine whether the sole or predominant item to which the royalties relate is a license. When the license is the sole or predominant item to which the sales-based royalty relates, we recognize revenue at the later of: (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any sales-based royalty revenue resulting from our arrangement.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Allocation of Transaction Price</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We allocate the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price. We must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We utilize key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Estimating costs for research and development programs is subjective as we estimate the costs anticipated to successfully complete the research performance obligations. As the research is novel, efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs at the beginning of the contract. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts we would expect to receive for satisfying each performance obligation.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Recognition of Revenue</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We utilize judgment to determine whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. We determine the appropriate method of measuring progress performance obligations satisfied over time for purposes of recognizing revenue, such as by using an input method based on costs incurred compared to the costs expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy the performance obligation. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The estimated remaining costs is highly subjective, as the research is novel, therefore efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs made at the balance sheet date. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We receive payments from customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Up-front payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until we perform our obligations under these arrangements.

Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (principal executive officer) and chief financial officer (principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&#160;31, 2020, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. We continue to review and document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a&#8211;15(f) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and our Board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 (&#8220;COSO criteria&#8221;). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221;.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">124</p></div></div>

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:12pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Organization</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Scholar Rock Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. The Company&#8217;s novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled the development of a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target these signaling proteins at the cellular level. The Company&#8217;s first product candidate, apitegromab (formerly SRK-015), is a highly selective fully human, monoclonal antibody, with a unique mechanism of action that results in the inhibition of the activation of the growth factor, myostatin, in skeletal muscle. Apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-directed therapy for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (&#8220;SMA&#8221;). Apitegromab is being evaluated in the Company&#8217;s TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA.  In October 2020, the Company announced positive six-month interim analysis results from the TOPAZ trial.  The Company&#8217;s second product candidate, SRK-181, is being developed for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitor (&#8220;CPI&#8221;) therapies, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody therapies. SRK-181 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent transforming growth factor beta-1 (&#8220;TGF&#946;1&#8221;). In May 2020, the Company announced the initiation of patient dosing in our DRAGON Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial of SRK-181 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies. Additionally, the Company continues to create a pipeline of novel product candidates with the potential to transform the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, and fibrosis. The Company was originally formed in May 2012. Its principal offices are in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Since its inception, the Company&#8217;s operations have focused on research and development of monoclonal antibodies that selectively inhibit activation of growth factors for therapeutic effect, as well as establishing the Company&#8217;s intellectual property portfolio and performing research and development activities. The Company has primarily financed its operations through various equity financings, including the initial public offering of its common stock (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;) in May 2018, a secondary offering in June 2019, and a follow-on offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants completed in November 2020 (Note 8), as well as research and development collaboration agreements.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Revenue generation activities have been limited to <ix:nonFraction unitRef="Unit_Standard_item_QaRuuTD-90i1-qN3HSAvhA" contextRef="Duration_1_1_2020_To_12_31_2020_QrfUldkeg0-HsSrzDtikUA" decimals="INF" format="ixt-sec:numwordsen" name="srrk:NumberOfAgreements" scale="0" id="Narr_1CHRTuBIrU-XoAKHXnmt2w">two</ix:nonFraction> collaborations, both containing research services and the issuance of a license. The first agreement, executed in 2013, was with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (&#8220;Janssen&#8221;), a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson. The second agreement (the &#8220;Gilead Collaboration Agreement&#8221;), executed in December 2018, was with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (&#8220;Gilead&#8221;). The Company began recognizing revenue on the Gilead Collaboration Agreement in 2019. No revenues have been recorded from the sale of any commercial product.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, successful discovery and development of its drug candidates, raising additional capital, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology and regulatory approval and market acceptance of the Company&#8217;s product candidates. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as it continues to develop its product candidates. The Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2020 will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operations through at least a period of one year after the date the financial statements are issued.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Basis of Presentation</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scholar Rock Holding Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset group for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset group to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset group are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset group over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. The Company did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets during the&#160;years ended December&#160;31, 2020 or 2019.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2020_To_12_31_2020_QrfUldkeg0-HsSrzDtikUA" name="us-gaap:LesseeLeasesPolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_YyLLugXAx0e77mw_V6tJVg" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Leases</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases (&#8220;ASC 842&#8221;), using the modified retrospective approach and utilizing the effective date as its date of initial application, for which prior periods are presented in accordance with the previous guidance in ASC Topic 840, Leases.

Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In accordance with the guidance in ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g. land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g. property taxes, insurance, etc.). Then the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. For operating leases, lease expense relating to fixed payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term and lease expense relating to variable payments is expensed as incurred.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2020_To_12_31_2020_QrfUldkeg0-HsSrzDtikUA" name="us-gaap:FairValueOfFinancialInstrumentsPolicy" id="Tb_PfAWA49Yo0eV_WcziaU4YQ" continuedAt="Tb_PfAWA49Yo0eV_WcziaU4YQ_cont1" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Fair Value Measurements</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (&quot;ASC 820&quot;), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company&#8217;s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company&#8217;s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. ASC 820 identifies fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.

Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i)&#160;identification of the contract(s)&#160;with the customer, (ii)&#160;identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii)&#160;measurement of the transaction price, (iv)&#160;allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v)&#160;recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company accounts for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of ASC 606 when all of the following criteria are met: (i)&#160;the arrangement has been approved by the parties and the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, (ii)&#160;each party&#8217;s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iii)&#160;the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iv)&#160;the arrangement has commercial substance and (v)&#160;collection of substantially all of the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer is probable.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company first evaluates license and/or collaboration arrangements to determine whether the arrangement (or part of the arrangement) represents a collaborative arrangement pursuant to ASC Topic 808,&#160;<i style="font-style:italic;">Collaborative Arrangements,</i>&#160;based on the risks and rewards and activities of the parties pursuant to the contractual arrangement.

As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must use significant judgment to determine: a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract; b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and c) the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. The Company uses judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are&#160;satisfied. In determining the stand-alone selling price of a license to the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology or a material right provided by a customer option, the Company considers market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its estimated stand-alone selling prices, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its estimated stand-alone selling prices will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between performance obligations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:2pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i)&#160;the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii)&#160;the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company allocates the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price. The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Estimating costs for research and development programs is subjective as the Company estimates the costs anticipated to successfully complete the research performance obligations. As the research is novel, efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs at the beginning of the contract. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts the Company would expect to receive for each performance obligation.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation in order to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time.

The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.

The Company receives payments from customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Up-front payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12&#160;months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12&#160;months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.

In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, the Company considers relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the collaboration partner can benefit from the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the arrangement.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">&#160;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:2pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Research and Development Services &#8211;&#160;</i>The promises under the Company&#8217;s collaboration and license agreements generally include research and development services to be performed by the Company on behalf of the collaboration partner. For performance obligations that include research and development services, the Company generally recognizes revenue allocated to such performance obligations based on an appropriate measure of progress. The Company utilizes judgment to determine the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue, which is generally an input measure, such as costs incurred. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period as described under&#160;<i style="font-style:italic;">Exclusive Licenses&#160;</i>above.

The Company evaluates the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates the transaction price to material rights based on the relative stand-alone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount, and the probability that the customer will exercise the option.

The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company reevaluates the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to the Company&#8217;s efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, the Company generally allocates the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:12pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Royalties &#8211;&#160;</i>For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued expense balances at the end of each reporting period.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2020_To_12_31_2020_QrfUldkeg0-HsSrzDtikUA" name="us-gaap:ShareBasedCompensationOptionAndIncentivePlansPolicy" id="Tb_o7sz93S3v0uwP9H423edsA" continuedAt="Tb_o7sz93S3v0uwP9H423edsA_cont1" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Equity-Based Compensation</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company accounts for equity awards, including common stock, restricted common stock, common stock options, granted as equity award compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation&#160;&#8212; Stock Compensation (&quot;ASC 718&quot;). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, which includes grants of employee equity awards, to be recognized as expense in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">The fair value of each restricted common stock award is based on the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock less any purchase price, if applicable. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock and certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the award, the risk-free rate, and expected dividends. Expected volatility is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information was available. The historical volatility is generally calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption. The Company uses the simplified method, under which the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The Company utilizes this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain nature of its </p></ix:nonNumeric></ix:continuation></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">F-13</p></div></div>

For awards subject to performance conditions, the Company recognizes equity award compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method over the remaining service period when management determines that achievement of the milestone is probable.

Comprehensive loss includes net loss and the change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the period.

The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income (losses) available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income (losses) for the period had been distributed. During periods of loss, there is no allocation required under the two-class method since the participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to fund the losses of the Company.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including pre-funded warrants and excluding restricted common stock. The Company calculates diluted net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, as applicable, after giving consideration to the dilutive effect of restricted common stock, warrants, pre-funded warrants, and stock options that are outstanding during the period. </p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2020_To_12_31_2020_QrfUldkeg0-HsSrzDtikUA" name="us-gaap:IncomeTaxPolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_q6J738gKb02zq_yUSGvRbA" continuedAt="Tb_q6J738gKb02zq_yUSGvRbA_cont1" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Income Taxes</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (&quot;ASC 740&quot;), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax basis. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the&#160;years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Marketable securities with a remaining maturity date greater than one&#160;year are classified as non-current. Marketable securities are maintained by an investment manager and consist of U.S. treasury securities. Marketable securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders&#8217; equity until realized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the underlying marketable security.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Although available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise, securities are generally held through maturity.

If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment that the Company considers to be &quot;other than temporary,&quot; the Company would reduce the investment to fair value through a charge to the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

As a result, certain implementation costs incurred in hosting arrangements will be deferred and amortized.

The standard requires that a financial asset or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Under current GAAP, a company only considered past events and current conditions in measuring an incurred loss. Under ASU 2016-13, the information that a company must consider is broadened in developing an expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The use of forecasted information incorporates more timely information in the estimate of expected credit loss. The guidance is applied using a modified retrospective, or prospective approach, depending on a specific amendment. In November 2019, the FASB deferred the effective date for smaller reporting companies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not anticipate a material impact to its net financial position or disclosures as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13. </p></ix:nonNumeric></ix:continuation></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">F-15</p></div></div>
