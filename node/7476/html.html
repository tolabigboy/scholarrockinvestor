<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">To preclude any possible uncertainty, I
have set forth on <U>Exhibit A</U> attached hereto a complete list of Developments that I have, alone or jointly with others, conceived,
developed or reduced to practice prior to the commencement of my employment with the Company that I consider to be my property
or the property of third parties and that I wish to have excluded from the scope of this Agreement (&ldquo;Prior Inventions&rdquo;).
If disclosure of any such Prior Invention would cause me to violate any prior confidentiality agreement, I understand that I am
not to list such Prior Inventions in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> but am only to disclose a cursory name for each such invention, a listing
of the party(ies) to whom it belongs and the fact that full disclosure as to such inventions has not been made for that reason.
I have also listed on <U>Exhibit A</U> all patents and patent applications in which I am named as an inventor, other than those
which have been assigned to the Company (&ldquo;<U>Other Patent Rights</U>&rdquo;). If no such disclosure is attached, I represent
that there are no Prior Inventions or Other Patent Rights. If, in the course of my employment with the Company, I incorporate a
Prior Invention into a Company product, process or machine or other work done for the Company, I hereby grant to the Company a
nonexclusive, royalty-free, paid-up, irrevocable, worldwide license (with the full right to sublicense) to make, have made, modify,
use, sell, offer for sale and import such Prior Invention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I will not incorporate, or permit to
be incorporated, Prior Inventions in any Company-Related Development without the Company&rsquo;s prior written consent.</P>

assign to the Company any Development which, in the sole judgment of the Company, reasonably exercised, is developed entirely on
my own time and does not relate to the business efforts or research and development efforts in which, during the period of my employment,
the Company actually is engaged or reasonably would be engaged, and does not result from the use of premises, resources, proprietary
information, know-how or equipment owned or leased by the Company. However, I will also promptly disclose to the Company any such
Developments for the purpose of determining whether they qualify for such exclusion. I understand that to the extent this Agreement
is required to be construed in accordance with the laws of any state which precludes a requirement in an employee agreement to
assign certain classes of inventions made by an employee, this paragraph 5 will be interpreted not to apply to any invention which
a court rules and/or the Company agrees falls within such classes. I also hereby waive all claims to any moral rights or other
special rights which I may have or accrue in any Company-Related Developments.</P>

I will not directly or indirectly, anywhere in the United States, whether as owner, partner, shareholder, director, manager, consultant,

If disclosure of any such Prior Invention would cause me to violate any prior confidentiality agreement, I understand that I am
not to list such Prior Inventions in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> but am only to disclose a cursory name for each such invention, a listing
of the party(ies) to whom it belongs and the fact that full disclosure as to such inventions has not been made for that reason.
I have also listed on <U>Exhibit A</U> all patents and patent applications in which I am named as an inventor, other than those
which have been assigned to the Company (&ldquo;<U>Other Patent Rights</U>&rdquo;). If no such disclosure is attached, I represent
that there are no Prior Inventions or Other Patent Rights. If, in the course of my employment with the Company, I incorporate a
Prior Invention into a Company product, process or machine or other work done for the Company, I hereby grant to the Company a
nonexclusive, royalty-free, paid-up, irrevocable, worldwide license (with the full right to sublicense) to make, have made, modify,
use, sell, offer for sale and import such Prior Invention. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I will not incorporate, or permit to

the Company actually is engaged or reasonably would be engaged, and does not result from the use of premises, resources, proprietary
information, know-how or equipment owned or leased by the Company. However, I will also promptly disclose to the Company any such
Developments for the purpose of determining whether they qualify for such exclusion. I understand that to the extent this Agreement
is required to be construed in accordance with the laws of any state which precludes a requirement in an employee agreement to
assign certain classes of inventions made by an employee, this paragraph 5 will be interpreted not to apply to any invention which
a court rules and/or the Company agrees falls within such classes. I also hereby waive all claims to any moral rights or other

breakthrough academic research to lead Scholar Rock through the initial start-up phase to create a special company now poised to
move multiple product candidates through clinical development and hopefully to patients in real need. On behalf of the entire board

of the Scholar Rock Board of Directors. &ldquo;Building on the tremendous foundation Nagesh has established, Tony&rsquo;s clinical
development, strategic, and commercial acumen will lead and drive Scholar Rock to further the company&rsquo;s great potential.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Dr. Mahanthappa is the founding employee of Scholar Rock, serving
as president, CEO and a member of the Board of Directors since 2012. Under his leadership the company has created a proprietary
platform for the discovery of innovative antibody therapeutics focused on exploiting the structural differences of the precursors,
or latent forms, of protein growth factors. During Dr. Mahanthappa&rsquo;s tenure as president and CEO, he has been instrumental
in developing the company&rsquo;s breakthrough research through to clinical trials for two distinct product candidates, securing
approximately $250 million in capital including an initial public offering, establishing value-creating collaborations with Gilead
Sciences, Inc. and Janssen Biotech, Inc., and building a team of more than 100 talented employees.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Scholar Rock has two product candidates in clinical development:
SRK-015 in a Phase 2 trial for the improvement of muscle function in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), and SRK-181 in
a Phase 1 trial in patients with solid tumors to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Both programs emerged from
in-house discovery programs and have the potential to deliver multiple clinical readouts this year. The company is also advancing
a strategic collaboration with Gilead to develop highly selective inhibitors of latent TGF&beta; activation for the treatment of
fibrotic disorders and continues to build upon its research excellence to bring new antibodies to the clinic.</P>

for the treatment of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. Scholar Rock&nbsp;is
creating a pipeline of novel product candidates with the potential to transform the lives of patients suffering from a wide range
of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, fibrosis and anemia. Scholar Rock&rsquo;s newly elucidated understanding
of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled it to develop a&nbsp;proprietary platform&nbsp;for the discovery

developing product candidates that act in the disease microenvironment, the Company intends to avoid the historical challenges
associated with inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect.&nbsp;Scholar Rock&nbsp;believes its focus on biologically validated
