and Procedures. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section&nbsp;6 of notice of the commencement of any action,
such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section&nbsp;6, notify
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i)&nbsp;will not relieve
it from liability under paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such
failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii)&nbsp;will not, in any event, relieve
the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a)&nbsp;or
(b)&nbsp;above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party&rsquo;s choice at the indemnifying
party&rsquo;s expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying
party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties
except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying

such separate counsel if (i)&nbsp;the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present
such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii)&nbsp;the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both
the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party,
(iii)&nbsp;the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party
within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv)&nbsp;the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified
party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party; provided, however, that an indemnifying party shall not be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one such separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in connection with any proceeding
or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
without its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified
party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by
Section&nbsp;6(a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent if (i)&nbsp;such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying
party of the aforesaid request, (ii)&nbsp;such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least
30 days before such settlement is entered into and (iii)&nbsp;such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party
in accordance with such request or disputed in good faith the indemnified party&rsquo;s entitlement to such reimbursement prior to the
date of such settlement. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim,
action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified
parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent: (i)&nbsp;includes an unconditional
release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii)&nbsp;does not include
an admission of fault.</P>

well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds
from the Offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Placement Agents shall be deemed to be equal
to the Placement Fee, in each case as set forth on the cover page&nbsp;of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined (i)&nbsp;in
the case of any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
by reference to, among other things, whether such statement or omission relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand
or the Placement Agents on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission; and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of any other action or omission, shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether such action or omission was taken or omitted to be taken by the Company or by the Placement
Agents and the parties&rsquo; relative intent, relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action
or omission. The Company and the Placement Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro
rata allocation (even if the Placement Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does
not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), in no event
shall a Placement Agent be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Placement Fee received by such Placement
Agent with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Placement Agent has otherwise been required
to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph
(d), in no event shall a Placement Agent be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total Placement Fee
received by such Placement Agent exceeds the amount of any damages that such Placement Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason
of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f)&nbsp;of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. The Placement Agents&rsquo; obligations to contribute pursuant to this paragraph (d)&nbsp;are several in
proportion to their Placement Fee and not joint. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;6, each person who controls the Placement Agents within
the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, affiliate and agent of the Placement
Agents shall have the same rights to contribution as the Placement Agents, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning
of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each
director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions
of this paragraph (d).</P>

whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with the Holder&rsquo;s for purposes of Section&nbsp;13(d)&nbsp;of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &ldquo;<B>Exchange Act</B>&rdquo;), to exceed 9.99% (the &ldquo;<B>Maximum Percentage</B>&rdquo;)

9.99% of the combined voting power of all of the securities of the Company then outstanding following such exercise. For purposes of this
Warrant, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock as reflected in (x)&nbsp;the Company&rsquo;s most recent Form&nbsp;10-Q or Form&nbsp;10-K, as the case may be, filed with the Commission
prior to the Exercise Date, (y)&nbsp;a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z)&nbsp;any other notice by the Company or the
Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written request of the Holder, the Company shall
within three (3)&nbsp;Trading Days confirm in writing or by electronic mail to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.
In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of
securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock was reported. By written notice to the Company, the Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to
any other percentage not in excess of 19.99% specified in such notice; provided that any such increase or decrease will not be effective
until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company. For purposes of this <U>Section&nbsp;11(a)</U>, the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock or voting securities beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and any other Persons whose
beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with the Holder&rsquo;s for purposes of Section&nbsp;13(d)&nbsp;of the Exchange
Act shall include the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being
made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (x)&nbsp;exercise of the remaining unexercised
and non-cancelled portion of this Warrant by the Holder and (y)&nbsp;exercise or conversion of the unexercised, non-converted or non-cancelled

which would entitle the holder thereof to acquire at any time Common Stock, including without limitation any debt, preferred stock, right,

an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A)&nbsp;of the immediately preceding sentence
the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable

and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder&rsquo;s Affiliates (such Persons, &ldquo;<U>Attribution
Parties</U>&rdquo;)), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below).&nbsp; For purposes of
the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties
shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is
being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i)&nbsp;exercise of the remaining, nonexercised
portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii)&nbsp;exercise or conversion
of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock
Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the
Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties.&nbsp; Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section&nbsp;2(e),

in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section&nbsp;2(e)&nbsp;applies, the determination of whether
this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties)
and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise
shall be deemed to be the Holder&rsquo;s determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by
the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject
to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination
and shall have no liability for exercises of this Warrant that are not in compliance with the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (other than
to the extent that information on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company is provided by the Company and relied
upon by the Holder). In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with
Section&nbsp;13(d)&nbsp;of the Exchange Act and the rules&nbsp;and regulations promulgated thereunder and the Company shall have no obligation
to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination and shall have no liability for exercises of this Warrant that are not in compliance
with the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;2(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A)&nbsp;the Company&rsquo;s most recent
periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B)&nbsp;a more recent public announcement by the Company or
(C)&nbsp;a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.&nbsp;
Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the
number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.&nbsp; In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined
after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates
or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The &ldquo;<U>Beneficial
Ownership Limitation</U>&rdquo; shall be 4.99% (or, upon election by a Holder prior to the issuance of any Warrants, 9.99%, 14.99% or
19.99%) of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation
provisions of this Section&nbsp;2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99%, 14.99% or 19.99% of
the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise
of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2(e)&nbsp;shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61<SUP>st</SUP>&nbsp;day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions
of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section&nbsp;2(e)&nbsp;to
correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation
herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.75in">2.1 <U>Closing</U>. On the
Closing Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Company agrees to sell and issue to the Purchasers, and
the Purchasers, severally and not jointly, agree to purchase, up to an aggregate of $205,000,001.50 of Shares and Warrants; <U>provided</U>,
<U>howeve</U>r, that, to the extent that a Purchaser determines, in its sole discretion, that such Purchaser (together with such Purchaser&rsquo;s
Affiliates, and any Person acting as a group together with such purchaser or any of such Purchaser&rsquo;s Affiliates) would beneficially
own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, or as such Purchaser may otherwise choose, in lieu of purchasing Shares such Purchaser
may elect to purchase Pre-Funded Warrants in lieu of Shares in such manner to result in the same aggregate purchase price being paid by
such Purchaser to the Company (minus an amount equal to the Exercise Price times the number of Pre-Funded Warrants, as defined in the
Pre-Funded Warrants) (and each such Purchaser of Pre-Funded Warrants will, for the avoidance of doubt, also receive Common Warrants as
though they purchased Shares). The &ldquo;<U>Beneficial Ownership Limitation</U>&rdquo; shall be 4.99% (or, at the election of the Purchaser
at Closing, 9.99% or 19.99%) of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of
the Securities on the Closing Date. Each Purchaser&rsquo;s Subscription Amount shall set forth on the signature page&nbsp;hereto and,
at the election of the Purchaser, the Purchaser may indicate that, upon Closing, its Subscription Amount shall not cause the beneficial
ownership of the Common Stock of it and its Affiliates on an aggregate basis to exceed 19.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the Securities on the Closing Date (calculated in accordance with Section&nbsp;13(d)&nbsp;of
the Exchange Act and the rules&nbsp;and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not
representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section&nbsp;13(d)&nbsp;of the Exchange Act), and after consultation
with the Purchaser the Subscription Amount shall be reduced automatically. Each Purchaser&rsquo;s Subscription Amount shall be made available
for &ldquo;Delivery Versus Payment&rdquo; settlement with the Company or its designee. The Company shall deliver to each Purchaser its
respective Shares and Warrants pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(a), and the Company and each Purchaser shall deliver the other items set forth
in Section&nbsp;2.2 deliverable at the Closing. Upon satisfaction of the covenants and conditions set forth in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, the
Closing shall occur at the offices of Cooley or such other location as the parties shall mutually agree. Settlement of the Shares shall
occur via &ldquo;Delivery Versus Payment&rdquo; (&ldquo;<U>DVP</U>&rdquo;) (i.e., on the Closing Date, the Company shall issue the Shares
registered in the Purchasers&rsquo; names and addresses and released by the Transfer Agent directly to the account(s)&nbsp;identified
by each Purchaser; upon receipt of such Shares, payment therefor shall be made by the Purchaser by wire transfer to the Company). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time on or after the time of execution of this Agreement by the Company and an applicable Purchaser,
through, and including the time immediately prior to the Closing (the &ldquo;<U>Pre-Settlement Period</U>&rdquo;), such Purchaser sells
to any Person all, or any portion, of the Shares to be issued hereunder to such Purchaser at the Closing (collectively, the &ldquo;<U>Pre-Settlement
Shares</U>&rdquo;), such Purchaser shall, automatically hereunder (without any additional required actions by such Purchaser or the Company),
be deemed to be unconditionally bound to purchase, such Pre-Settlement Shares at the Closing; provided, that the Company shall not be
required to deliver any Pre-Settlement Shares to such Purchaser prior to the Company&rsquo;s receipt of the purchase price of such Pre-Settlement
Shares hereunder; and provided further that the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that the forgoing shall not constitute a representation
or covenant by such Purchaser as to whether or not during the Pre-Settlement Period such Purchaser shall sell any shares of Common Stock
to any Person and that any such decision to sell any shares of Common Stock by such Purchaser shall solely be made at the time such Purchaser
elects to effect any such sale, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Notice(s)&nbsp;of Exercise (as defined in the
Pre-Funded Warrants) delivered on or prior to 12:00 p.m.&nbsp;(New York City time) on the Closing Date, which may be delivered at any
time after the time of execution of the this Agreement, the Company agrees to deliver the Warrant Shares subject to such notice(s)&nbsp;by
4:00 p.m.&nbsp;(New York City time) on the Closing Date and the Closing Date shall be the Warrant Share Delivery Date (as defined in the
Pre-Funded Warrants) for purposes hereunder.</P>

role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title), each Person who controls such Purchaser
(within the meaning of Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act and Section&nbsp;20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, shareholders,
agents, members, partners or employees (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding
a lack of such title or any other title) of such controlling persons (each, a &ldquo;<U>Purchaser Party</U>&rdquo;) harmless from any
and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in
settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs of investigation that any such Purchaser Party may suffer or incur
as a result of or relating to (a)&nbsp;any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Company
in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents or (b)&nbsp;any action or claim instituted or made against the Purchaser Parties
in any capacity, or any of them or their respective Affiliates, by any stockholder of the Company who is not an Affiliate of such Purchaser
Party or any other third party (including a derivative action brought on behalf of the Company) (a &ldquo;<U>Covered Action</U>&rdquo;),
with respect to, or arising out of or resulting from, any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. If any Covered
Action shall be brought against any Purchaser Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Purchaser
Party shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of
its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser Party. Any Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such Covered Action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
Purchaser Party except to the extent that (i)&nbsp;the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing,
(ii)&nbsp;the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (iii)&nbsp;in such
Covered Action there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material conflict on any material issue between the position of the Company
and the position of such Purchaser Party, in which case the Company shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more
than one such separate counsel. The Company will not be liable to any Purchaser Party under this Agreement (y)&nbsp;for any settlement
by a Purchaser Party effected without the Company&rsquo;s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
or (z)&nbsp;to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any Purchaser Party&rsquo;s
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such Purchaser Party in this Agreement or in the other
Transaction Documents. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser Party, consent to entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such Purchaser Party of a release from all liability in respect to such Covered Action, and such settlement shall not include
any admission as to fault on the part of the Purchaser Party. The indemnification required by this Section&nbsp;4.8 shall be made by periodic
payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred. The
indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right of any Purchaser Party against the
Company or others and any liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to law.</P>

with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently
protect and enforce its rights including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction
Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any Proceeding for such purpose.
Each Purchaser has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in its review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. For
reasons of administrative convenience only, each Purchaser and its respective counsel have chosen to communicate with the Company through
Cooley. Cooley does not represent any of the Purchasers and only represents the Placement Agent. The Company has elected to provide all
Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested
to do so by any of the Purchasers. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement and in each other
Transaction Document is between the Company and a Purchaser, solely, and not between the Company and the Purchasers collectively and not
between and among the Purchasers.</P>

enable Scholar Rock Holding Corporation (the &ldquo;<U>Company</U>&rdquo;) to grant equity awards to induce highly-qualified prospective
officers and employees to accept employment and provide them with a proprietary interest in the Company.&nbsp; It is anticipated that
providing such persons with a direct stake in the Company&rsquo;s welfare will assure a closer identification of their interests with
those of the Company and its stockholders, thereby stimulating their efforts on the Company&rsquo;s behalf and strengthening their desire
to remain with the Company. The Company intends that the Plan be reserved for persons to whom the Company can issue securities without
stockholder approval as an inducement pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Scholar Rock&nbsp;is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused
on the discovery and development of innovative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors
plays a fundamental role.&nbsp;Scholar Rock&nbsp;is creating a pipeline of novel product candidates with the potential to transform the
lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, and fibrosis. Scholar Rock&rsquo;s
approach to targeting the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled it to develop a&nbsp;proprietary platform&nbsp;for
the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target these signaling proteins at the cellular level.
By developing product candidates that act in the disease microenvironment, Scholar Rock intends to avoid the historical challenges associated
with inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect.&nbsp;Scholar Rock&nbsp;believes its focus on biologically validated growth factors
may facilitate a more efficient development path.</P>
