in accordance with the terms of the pre-funded warrants. Such percentage may be increased or decreased by written notice by the holder
of the pre-funded warrants to any other percentage not in excess of 19.99%. Such increase or decrease will not be effective until the

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Although it is not entirely free from doubt, a pre-funded warrant should
be treated as a share of our common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes and a holder of a pre-funded warrant should generally be
taxed in the same manner as a holder of common stock. Accordingly, no gain or loss should be recognized upon the exercise of a pre-funded
warrant and, upon exercise, the holding period of a pre-funded warrant should carry over to the share of common stock received. Similarly,
the tax basis of a pre-funded warrant should carry over to the share of common stock received upon exercise, increased by the exercise
price (if applicable). Each holder of pre-funded warrants should consult his, her or its own tax advisor regarding the risks associated
with the acquisition of pre-funded warrants pursuant to this offering (including potential alternative characterizations).</P>

the underwriting agreement described in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement on terms generally consistent with those applicable to the

the underwriting discounts and commissions per share of common stock sold in the offering.</P>
