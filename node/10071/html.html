Our approach of targeting the precursor, or latent forms of growth factors is based on the breakthrough discovery by the laboratory of our cofounder, Timothy&#160;A. Springer, Ph.D. of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Unlike many other proteins that are produced and secreted by cells in a mature, or active, form, many growth factors are expressed by cells in a latent form. For example, TGF&#946;1 is produced by cells as a single protein which is then enzymatically processed by the cells into two distinct and physically separated domains&#160;&#8212; the mature growth factor and the remaining portion of the original protein, referred to as the prodomain&#160;&#8212; which remain associated as part of a complex. This secreted complex is latent, or inactive, and must first be activated to carry out its normal function in a highly localized tissue or disease microenvironment. In a seminal peer-reviewed publication in 2011, Dr.&#160;Springer elucidated a new understanding of the mechanism of activation of the latent growth factor complex among members of the TGF&#946; superfamily by solving a high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of this latent form of TGF&#946;1 (as illustrated in the graphic below).</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">7</p></div></div>

The prodomain, though physically separated from the mature growth factor domain, forms&#160;a &#8220;cage&#8221; around the active form of TGF&#946;1, blocking the growth factor from signaling through its receptor. Only when the cage is &#8220;unlocked&#8221; by a precursor activation event can the growth factor be released and mediate its effects in the local microenvironment. Dr.&#160;Springer further hypothesized that this phenomenon likely holds true for most members of the TGF&#946; superfamily, though the exact nature of the activation event, such as integrin binding or enzymatic cleavage, may differ among members of the superfamily. Importantly, while many growth factors are structurally very similar, their cages are structurally diverse, and this provides the basis for our approach to improved selectivity.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We believe that there are several important advantages to our approach of targeting the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors over conventional therapeutic approaches, which inhibit mature growth factors or their receptors systemically throughout the body:</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">targeting the latent precursor allows intervention at the site of action, within the microenvironment of the diseased tissue. Because our antibodies specifically bind the latent forms of the growth factors, we can prevent the activation of the growth factors. Given that many growth factors act primarily within the microenvironment where they are activated, as opposed to exerting their effects systemically, we believe that prevention of activation is a preferred mode of action for achieving improved outcomes. In contrast, traditional approaches to targeting growth factor signaling are focused on inhibiting the growth factor after it has been activated and released systemically;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">targeting the latent precursor allows heightened selectivity among structurally related growth factors, which we believe could limit off target effects. For example, two members of the TGF&#946; superfamily, myostatin and GDF11, are 90% identical in their growth factor domains. Therefore, many of the traditional inhibitors that target myostatin also inadvertently inhibit GDF11. Similarly, most of the known inhibitors of TGF&#946; are paninhibitors, meaning that they do not distinguish among the three isoforms of TGF&#946;, namely, TGF&#946;1, TGF&#946; 2 and TGF&#946;3. Despite the sequence similarities of the active forms of these growth factors, their cages are structurally diverse.

Both antibodies are novel, highly selective inhibitors of the activation of myostatin from its inactive precursor in skeletal muscle, where myostatin resides and signals upon activation. While mature myostatin is 90% identical in the growth factor domain to its most closely related TGF&#946; superfamily member, GDF11, the prodomain that cages mature myostatin and keeps it in its latent precursor form is only 52% identical to the GDF11 prodomain.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In preclinical studies, we have shown that apitegromab selectively avoids interaction with other closely related growth factors that play distinct physiological roles. We observed multi-fold increases in serum latent myostatin levels in mouse models of both early and late SMN restoration and that apitegromab promoted increased strength (as measured by torque generation) in SMN-deficient mice. In a Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (&#8220;PK&#8221;) /pharmacodynamic (&#8220;PD&#8221;) profile of apitegromab in adult healthy volunteers, there were no dose-limiting toxicities and we observed robust and sustained target engagement following administration of apitegromab.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">SRK-439 has also shown robust preclinical efficacy, as detailed in &#8220;Cardiometabolic Disorders &#8211; SRK-439 (inhibitor of latent myostatin)&#8221; section below.

Animals lacking functional myostatin genes, or its receptor, have larger muscles and increased strength compared to normal animals. While the absence of myostatin does lead to overall increases in muscle mass, a preferential effect on muscles enriched for fast twitch muscle fibers has been observed in animals. Such animals are otherwise healthy and live a normal lifespan.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">ii.  Traditional Approaches and Challenges</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 99.35pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;margin-left:0pt;visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Because of its role in regulating muscle mass, myostatin has been a popular target for a variety of drug development programs. There have been two general approaches to trying to inhibit the signaling of myostatin in humans. The first is to develop an antibody, or an antibody-like molecule, that binds to mature myostatin in circulation and prevents its ability to signal through its receptor, the ActRIIb receptor. The second is to develop an antibody to the ActRIIb receptor itself, or a soluble decoy of the ActRIIb receptor, with a goal of preventing myostatin signaling through its receptor. Both of these approaches, however, have significant limitations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As a member of the TGF&#946; superfamily, mature myostatin shares considerable structural similarity with other family members. For example, the active form of myostatin and its most closely related family member, GDF11, are 90% identical in the growth factor domains, making it extremely challenging to identify antibodies that are truly specific for myostatin and do not interfere with other targets. Moreover, attempts to interrupt myostatin signaling through its receptor are complicated by the fact that the ActRIIb receptor, in addition to being the receptor for myostatin, is also the receptor for a number of related family members, including GDF11, activins and other growth factors. Attempts to block the signaling of myostatin by targeting its receptor therefore inevitably interfere with the signaling of these other growth factors, many of which are involved in normal biological processes unrelated to muscle.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">There are multiple examples of clinical trials demonstrating the risk of non-selective inhibition of myostatin. For example, in a Phase&#160;2 clinical trial in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy reported in 2017, a soluble decoy of the ActRIIb receptor resulted in bleeding side effects believed by the sponsor to be unrelated to inhibition of myostatin signaling, but instead related to the inhibition of signaling by certain other members of the TGF&#946; superfamily known to be important in the maintenance of vascular integrity. These side effects resulted in termination of the clinical program. More recently, results from a clinical trial were reported showing that treatment of patients with an antibody to the ActRIIb receptor resulted in suppression of the levels of follicle stimulating hormone, an important reproductive hormone. In this clinical trial, the sponsor believed that these effects were likely related to inhibition of signaling through the ActRIIb receptor.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">iii.  Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Apitegromab (inhibitor of latent myostatin activation)</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 99.35pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;margin-left:0pt;visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;">We believe that the therapeutic potential for apitegromab in improving motor function is more optimal when a given disease bears certain features. Based on our translational and preclinical efforts, we have formulated a set of guiding principles to inform indication selection within the category of neuromuscular disease. As summarized in the table below, we believe that the pathobiological and clinical characteristics of SMA are well-aligned with these guiding principles. Since myostatin regulates muscle catabolism rather than anabolism, we believe that having a background of anabolic capacity is important to drive muscle growth in the setting of myostatin inhibition. Anabolic capacity is most robust in younger individuals and diminishes as one ages. SMA is a genetic disorder with onset commonly in childhood, and the initial focus of the development program will be in children and young adults. Furthermore, in SMA, there is a significant but incomplete loss of motor neurons, ensuring at least some intact signaling between skeletal muscle and nerve. In addition, generally, there are also no apparent structural abnormalities in the skeletal muscle. The partial loss of motor neurons causes substantial atrophy of fast-twitch muscle fibers that in turn leads to many of the motor function impairments. Validated outcome measures are available for SMA clinical trials that are relevant to fast-twitch fiber activity. These outcome measures, such as the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale &#8211; Expanded (&#8220;HFMSE&#8221;), assess motor activities that involve short-term bursts of strength, which are driven by fast-twitch muscle fibers. These endpoints therefore measure an outcome that may be more likely to be directly affected by apitegromab.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">13</p></div></div>

Myostatin, a member of the TGF&#946; superfamily of growth factors, is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle cells and the absence of its gene is associated with an increase in muscle mass and strength in multiple animal species. We believe that inhibition of the activation of myostatin may promote a clinically meaningful increase in motor function.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Apitegromab was evaluated in our Phase 2 TOPAZ proof-of-concept clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA and positive 12-month top-line results were announced in April 2021. See &#8220;Phase 2 TOPAZ Trial Analysis&#8221; below. We are currently conducting SAPPHIRE, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apitegromab in patients with nonambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA receiving SMN therapy. We completed enrollment of SAPPHIRE in 2023, with the top-line data readout expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. If successful and if apitegromab is approved, we expect to initiate a commercial product launch in 2025.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We believe that apitegromab has the potential to be the first muscle-targeted therapy which is aimed at improving motor function in patients with SMA who are receiving an SMN therapy. We have identified multiple other diseases for which the selective inhibition of the activation of myostatin may offer therapeutic benefit, including additional patient populations in SMA (such as patients under the age of two with SMA and ambulatory patients with SMA) and indications for other neuromuscular disorders beyond SMA. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 126pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">1.  Background on SMA</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">SMA is a rare, and often fatal, genetic disorder that typically manifests in young children. It is characterized by the loss of motor neurons, atrophy of the voluntary muscles of the limbs and trunk and progressive muscle weakness. Disease severity in SMA can range from patients who die soon after birth to patients who live into adulthood with varying degrees of morbidity. The underlying pathology of SMA is caused by insufficient production of a protein known as &#8220;survival of motor neuron,&#8221; or SMN. The SMN protein, essential for the survival of motor neurons, is encoded by two genes, SMN1 and SMN2.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">SMN1 genes produce the majority of functional SMN protein; healthy individuals have one or two functional copies of SMN1, while patients with SMA have mutations in or deletions of both copies of the gene.</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">SMN2 genes produce only 10% to 20% of functional SMN protein and an individual&#8217;s copy number of the SMN2 gene can range from zero to eight.

SMA Natural History and Epidemiology</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">SMA, the most common monogenic cause of death in infants, is a rare neuromuscular disorder. An estimated 20,000 patients suffer from SMA in the U.S. and Europe alone. Patients with SMA can be categorized as one of four types, Type 1 through Type 4. The majority of SMA patients currently living in the U.S. and Europe are estimated as having Type 2 or Type 3 disease, although it should be noted that this percentage may evolve over time and the definitions of traditional SMA types are themselves evolving. Nonambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA, as they have traditionally been defined, is the initial focus of investigation in our SMA development program.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 126pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">3.  Unmet Medical Need in SMA</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We view the emerging landscape for the development of novel medicines for SMA as being classified into two distinct but complementary therapeutic strategies: 1) SMN therapy (also known as SMN corrector therapy or SMN-directed therapy) and 2) muscle-targeted therapy. Despite progress in the development of SMN therapies, a high unmet medical need to improve motor function remains. We believe that the advancement of muscle-targeted therapy will be necessary to address this important gap.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">SMN therapies are aimed at addressing the SMN deficiency to prevent further motor neuron deterioration thus modifying the course of disease. This category includes antisense oligonucleotide and small molecule approaches to increase SMN2 expression as well as gene therapy to deliver the SMN1 gene. Early intervention at a very young age is therefore thought to be essential to prevent significant motor functional deterioration. However, for the vast majority of SMA patients living today, this early intervention window has been missed, and such individuals suffer from severe functional impairment. Thus, regardless of the precise nature or mechanism of action for any given SMN therapy, we believe that most SMA patients will continue to experience clinically significant functional deficits. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">To address this need, apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-targeted therapy for SMA. We envision the potential for apitegromab to be standard use with any SMN therapy in patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA in order to drive absolute increases in functional performance over baseline. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 126pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">4.

The FDA granted fast track designation, rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA in May 2021, August 2020 and March 2018, respectively. The EMA granted PRIME designation in March 2021 and the EC granted orphan medicinal product designation in December 2018 to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 126pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">5.

A total of 188 patients aged 2-21 years old with nonambulatory Type 2 or Type 3 SMA who are receiving an SMN therapy, either nusinersen or risdiplam, are enrolled in the study, including 156 patients aged 2-12 years old in the main efficacy population and 32 patients aged 13-21 years old in the exploratory subpopulation. Patients in the main efficacy population were randomized 1:1:1 to receive for 12 months either apitegromab 10 mg/kg, apitegromab 20 mg/kg, or placebo by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks.

Phase 2 TOPAZ Proof-of-Concept Trial</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We completed enrollment in our Phase 2 TOPAZ proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab in SMA in January 2020. One patient discontinued from the 12-month treatment period for reasons that were determined to be unrelated to apitegromab treatment. All remaining patients completed the 12-month treatment period and opted into the extension period. <span style="letter-spacing:0.25pt;">More than 90 percent of nonambulatory patients remained on treatment in the extension study</span>. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The clinical trial consisted of three distinct cohorts of patients with Type 2 or Type 3 SMA and evaluated the safety and efficacy of apitegromab over a 12-month treatment period. All patients in the clinical trial received apitegromab dosed every four weeks (Q4W) either as a monotherapy or in conjunction with an approved SMN therapy. In our view, this approach of having evaluated multiple distinct cohorts offers a greater number of opportunities to discern the effects of apitegromab on clinically meaningful motor function measures across multiple patient subpopulations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The primary efficacy objectives evaluated in the TOPAZ trial, HFMSE and Revised Hammersmith Scale (&#8220;RHS&#8221;), are clinically meaningful outcome measures validated for SMA. The HFMSE is a validated measure for the assessment of gross motor function in SMA, while the RULM is validated to evaluate upper limb motor performance by evaluating tasks which correspond to the ability to perform various everyday activities with their hands and arms. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Our overall approach to the efficacy analysis is informed by SMA disease biology, the anticipated mechanism of action of apitegromab, the effects of SMN therapy, and available clinical data on SMA. The primary effect of SMN therapy appears to be to address the SMN deficiency and the resulting motor neuron degeneration Natural history data indicate that most patients with Types 2 or 3 SMA, other than very young individuals, generally have a stable functional baseline over a 12-month period as evidenced by their HFMSE scores. Long-term data on patients treated with SMN therapy showed that motor function generally plateaus after an initial increase. A one-point improvement on the Hammersmith scale may be considered meaningful on an individual level and an improvement of 3 or more points from baseline would be considered meaningful.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 126pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">7.

As shown in the table above, the mean change from baseline in HFMSE at 36 months was +4.0 and mean change from baseline in RULM (measuring upper limb function) at 36 months was +2.4. These analyses exclude data for patients post scoliosis surgery as such surgery is a known confounding factor for motor function assessment.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Improvement in patient-reported outcomes were consistent with improvements in motor function. Nonambulatory patients (ages 2-21) had improvements in PEDI-CAT (measure of activities of daily living) and PROMIS-Fatigue (a patient-reported questionnaire measuring fatigue) that were sustained at 36 months. The mean change in PEDI-CAT daily activity domain from baseline at 36 months was 2.2 (95% CI: &#8211;0.1, 4.5; N=17), indicating an improvement in the ability to perform daily activities. The mean change in PROMIS-Fatigue from baseline at 36 months was &#8211;4.6 (95% CI: &#8211;8.7, &#8211;0.5; N=14), indicating a decline in fatigue. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Treatment-emergent adverse events (&#8220;TEAEs&#8221;) at 36 months were consistent with previous reports at 12 and 24 months, with no new findings after an aggregate of 198 patient-years of exposure. TEAEs were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity, and generally consistent with the underlying patient population and background therapy. The five most common TEAEs were headache, pyrexia, COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. No deaths or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions or hypersensitivity reactions were observed with apitegromab at 36 months. No patients displayed positive titers for apitegromab antibodies (&#8220;ADA&#8221;).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 126pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">8.  TOPAZ 12-Month Analysis</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">On April 6, 2021, we announced positive top-line data for the 12-month treatment period of our Phase 2 TOPAZ proof-of-concept trial, which enrolled 58 patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA across 16 study sites in the United States and Europe. The clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of intravenous apitegromab dosed every four weeks (Q4W) over a 12-month treatment period. Four patients (one in Cohort 2 and three in Cohort 3) each missed three consecutive doses of apitegromab over the course of the 12-month treatment period due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions and were excluded from the prespecified intent-to-treat primary analysis.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The study participants were enrolled into one of three cohorts. Cohort 1 consisted of individuals aged 5&#8211;21 years with ambulatory Type 3 SMA; receiving apitegromab either as a monotherapy or in conjunction with an approved SMN therapy (nusinersen). Cohort 2 comprised individuals aged 5&#8211;21 years with Type 2 or nonambulatory Type 3 SMA who were all receiving nusinersen and had initiated their nusinersen therapy after reaching 5 years of age. Cohort 3 consisted of nonambulatory individuals aged 2 years or older with Type 2 SMA who were receiving nusinersen and had initiated their nusinersen therapy before 5 years of age. All patients received apitegromab by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. During the primary treatment period, patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 received open-label apitegromab 20 mg/kg, and patients in Cohort 3 were randomized to double-blind apitegromab 2 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg. In the extension periods, patients who received apitegromab 20 mg/kg in the primary treatment period continued their dose; patients originally receiving apitegromab 2 mg/kg transitioned to apitegromab 20 mg/kg.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Results of the primary analysis showed that apitegromab treatment was associated with improved motor function as measured by the HFMSE and the RULM, and with a favorable safety profile at 12 months (Crawford Neurology 2024 and table below). An ITT sensitivity analysis of efficacy including data from all 58 patients enrolled showed consistent findings.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">17</p></div></div>

Phase 1 Healthy Volunteer Clinical Trial Results</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><span style="background:#ffffff;">The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and PD of IV administered </span>apitegromab<span style="background:#ffffff;"> in adult healthy volunteers. A total of 66 subjects were enrolled, including 40 subjects in the single ascending dose (&#8220;SAD&#8221;) and 26 subjects in the multiple ascending dose portions of the study. Full results from the Phase 1 clinical trial were presented at the Cure SMA Annual Conference in June 2019.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Safety and immunogenicity results. </i>Apitegromab was shown to be well-tolerated with no apparent safety signals. There were no dose-limiting toxicities identified up to the highest tested dose of 30 mg/kg, treatment-related serious adverse events (&#8220;SAEs&#8221;) or hypersensitivity reactions. Immunogenicity was assessed by anti-drug antibody testing, and all subjects tested negative.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics results. </i>Apitegromab displayed a PK profile generally consistent with that commonly observed with monoclonal antibodies. Drug exposure was dose proportional, and the serum half-life was approximately 23 to 33 days across the apitegromab dose groups. The findings supported the investigation of a once every 4-week dosing regimen in the Phase 2 TOPAZ clinical trial.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Mean serum concentrations of latent myostatin in the SAD were &lt; 20 ng/ml in the pre-treatment baselines for apitegromab treated subjects as well as in placebo subjects throughout the study. Following placebo treatment, there was no meaningful change in the latent myostatin biomarker concentrations. Following single doses of apitegromab at dose levels of 3 mg/kg or greater, marked increases in latent myostatin biomarker concentrations in the serum, by at least an order of magnitude, were observed following apitegromab treatment. This finding demonstrates successful target engagement and provides initial proof-of-mechanism in humans of our therapeutic approach of targeting the latent form of growth factors. The observation also corroborates our biological understanding that the vast majority of drug target (pro and latent forms of myostatin) resides within skeletal muscle rather than within the systemic circulation.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">19</p></div></div>

Apitegromab in Other Disorders Where the Inhibition of Myostatin May Be Beneficial</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">We see potential for apitegromab broadly across SMA (such as patients under the age of two with SMA and ambulatory patients with SMA) and our intention is to further investigate this potential. We also believe that the role of apitegromab as a muscle-targeted therapy has broad potential beyond SMA, spanning a number of muscle disorders in which fast-twitch fibers may play an important role in motor function. In some settings, we believe that disease-stabilizing therapy may be necessary to address the underlying defect, which can then be complemented by the potential motor function-building benefit of apitegromab. In settings in which the defect may be less severe and/or the disease may have a slower rate of progression, apitegromab may have the potential to serve as a monotherapy.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Based on this evidence, we believe a wide range of potential therapeutic applications may be envisioned for apitegromab. We are considering the investigation of apitegromab in multiple indications beyond SMA and have efforts underway to evaluate these opportunities (including preclinical and translational research, clinical development and regulatory path assessments, and commercial assessments).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">iv.

The Current State of Obesity and Obesity Treatment</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Obesity is now recognized as a top global public health issue, representing a large market with growing numbers: By the year 2030, it&#8217;s estimated that obesity will affect over 1 billion adults and over 250 million children and adolescents. This is a costly chronic disease, associated with more than $170 billion in excess costs annually in the US given serious </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">20</p></div></div>

The GLP-1 receptor agonists, and other incretin therapies, have been highly effective in reducing overall weight, but that weight loss includes a significant amount&#8212;an estimated 25-40%&#8212;of lean muscle mass loss as well. Importantly, there is rebound weight gain upon discontinuation of treatment that is primarily fat with lean muscle mass lagging behind. In addition to the weight gain rebound, patients taking GLP-1 RA therapies have experienced issues with tolerability that influence the duration of treatment and can lead to high rates of discontinuation for these therapies. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 126pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">2.  The Role of Muscle and The Opportunity for Myostatin Inhibition</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Muscle plays a key role in metabolic functions and energy homeostasis, and given that important role, we believe that maintaining lean muscle mass is essential for healthy and sustainable weight loss management. The preservation of lean mass has many benefits for overall health above and beyond maintaining strength, especially in the setting of obesity with associated co-morbidities. Specifically, muscle is a metabolic organ and increases basal metabolic rate, enhances glucose uptake, enhances insulin sensitivity, and given the cross talk between adipose tissue and muscle, reduces visceral body fat. All of these functions are important for healthy weight loss management.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The increasing recognition of the important role of skeletal muscle in modulating metabolic physiology highlights a potential therapeutic opportunity for myostatin blockade. For example, data emerging from our preclinical experiments support the hypothesis that blockade of the myostatin pathway has the potential to reduce the mass of visceral fat, a significant driver of cardiometabolic pathophysiology. Excessive fat mass and metabolic abnormalities have been observed in many muscle atrophy states, such as SMA and spinal cord injury. More broadly, reducing visceral fat mass, or improving body compositions (e.g., enhanced muscle-to-fat ratios), may be a potential therapeutic strategy to address a wide range of disorders, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (&#8220;NASH&#8221;), diabetes, and obesity.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 126pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">3.  SRK-439: A Novel Anti-myostatin Antibody for the Treatment of Obesity</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">In addition to our work to advance apitegromab in SMA, we have leveraged our expertise in anti-myostatin and its effect on increasing muscle mass to develop myostatin-selective inhibitors for cardiometabolic disorders, including obesity. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">SRK-439, a novel anti-myostatin antibody developed by Scholar Rock, has attractive properties that we believe make it specifically suited for the patient population with obesity. These properties include high in vitro affinity for pro- and latent myostatin, maintenance of myostatin specificity (i.e., no GDF11 or Activin-A binding), and a developability profile, including suitability for subcutaneous dosing and a low dosing volume. We believe the selectivity of these antibodies enables a favorable risk-benefit profile for patients with cardiometabolic disorders.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">In addition to these properties, SRK-439 has shown robust preclinical efficacy. In two models of DIO mice, SRK-439 maintained lean mass when combined with a GLP-1 RA therapy, either semaglutide or liraglutide. In both cases, adding SRK-439 to semaglutide or liraglutide alone demonstrated dose dependent increase and reversal of lean muscle mass loss with improvement in fat mass loss as well compared to a GLP-1 RA alone (results for SRK-439 used in combination with semaglutide shown below). These results provide the scientific rationale and support the hypothesis that inhibition of myostatin in combination with GLP-1 RA-driven weight loss may lead to retention of lean muscle.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">We are advancing this preclinical program and plan to submit an IND in mid-2025.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">21</p></div></div>

Apitegromab in Obesity: Proof-of-Concept</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">We see potential for apitegromab as a muscle-targeted therapy broadly across disorders in which the role of muscle is critical for function. Based on evidence of apitegromab&#8217;s improvement of muscle function in SMA, and to inform the development of SRK-439, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab in combination with a GLP-RA agonist, while at the same time advancing our cardiometabolic program with SRK-439 toward an IND. Phase 1 healthy volunteer data for apitegromab are summarized in the SMA section above.

The foundation of our industry-leading platform is targeting the TGF superfamily of growth factors with the desired selectivity for both the target (i.e., latent- or pro- form) and disease-specific context. While we are building our experience from this approach with our anti-myostatin pipeline, we have also observed promising preclinical and early clinical data that supports targeting other forms of TGF&#946;, including for oncology and fibrosis.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The TGF&#946; superfamily plays a central role in a wide range of cellular processes including growth and differentiation, immune regulation and fibrosis. TGF&#946;1 is produced by cells as a single protein chain and is then enzymatically processed by the cells into two distinct and physically separated domains &#8212; the mature, active growth factor and the remaining portion of the original protein, referred to as the prodomain, or latency associated peptide &#8212; which remains associated with and keeps the growth factor in an inactive state. This complex is further associated with one of a number of &#8220;presenting molecules&#8221; which when secreted serve to tether the latent precursor in specific locations in the body. TGF&#946;1 is produced by a variety of cell types, including fibroblasts, which deposit latent TGF&#946;1 in connective tissue, as well as regulatory T cells, cancer cells and macrophages, which display latent TGF&#946;1 on their cell surfaces. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">In a seminal peer-reviewed publication in 2011, by solving a high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of the latent form of TGF&#946;1, our founder, Dr. Springer elucidated a new understanding of the mechanism that underlies the activation of latent precursor forms of members of the TGF&#946; superfamily of protein growth factors. This research explained at a molecular level why the secreted form of TGF&#946;1 is inactive. The prodomain, though physically separated from the mature growth factor domain, forms a &#8220;cage&#8221; around the active form of TGF&#946;1, blocking the ability of the growth factor </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">22</p></div></div>

Integrin proteins are able to unlock the &#8220;cage&#8221; by binding to the prodomain of the latent TGF&#946;1 complex and applying force to pull the complex open, allowing the mature growth factor to be released and signal in its microenvironment. While mature TGF&#946;1 shares a high degree of structural similarity with its closely related family members, TGF&#946;2 and TGF&#946;3, their respective cages are structurally diverse. By taking advantage of the differences among the prodomains, together with our understanding of the activation mechanism and ability to recapitulate the activation mechanism in vitro, we were able to identify multiple highly selective inhibitors of the activation of latent TGF&#946;1. By specifically targeting the TGF&#946;1 isoform, we believe we have the key to unlock the power of checkpoint inhibitors and meaningfully increase response rates across multiple solid tumor types. In March 2019, we selected SRK-181 as a product candidate in our TGF&#946;1 cancer immunotherapy program based on the strength of preclinical data and human translational insights. In vitro and in vivo studies of SRK-181 showed that it binds to latent TGF&#946;1 with high affinity and high selectivity, which is evidenced by minimal or no binding to latent TGF&#946;2 or latent TGF&#946;3 isoforms. Integrins, such as &#945;V&#946;6 and &#945;V&#946;8, can trigger the activation of TGF&#946;1 and TGF&#946;3. In addition, biochemical evidence suggests that certain proteases (e.g., Plasmin and Kallikreins) may also induce TGF&#946; activation. Notably, these integrins and proteases have been implicated in tumor biology in a number of human cancers. SRK-181 is capable of inhibiting both integrin-dependent- and protease-induced activation of TGF&#946;1.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><img src="../../../cdn.kscope.io/e245980c73bad6a5f29cd43e0f6c6660-srrk-20231231x10k013.jpg" alt="Graphic" style="display:inline-block;height:198.25pt;width:414.3pt;"/></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">SRK-181 selectively binds to proTGF&#946;1complexes with minimal or no binding to proTGF&#946;2 or proTGF&#946;3 complexes.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">i.

Immune checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1/PD-L1, have therefore become key therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment. By inhibiting these proteins, the brakes on the immune system are released, allowing the T cells to kill the cancer cells. There are currently multiple approved checkpoint inhibitor therapies that target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">A significant proportion of patients, in many cases the majority, fail to respond to these checkpoint inhibitor therapies, because they have what appears to be a pre-existing, or primary, resistance to immunotherapy. Other patients&#8217; cancers appear to initially respond but subsequently progress. In many human cancers, TGF&#946; signaling is associated with lack of response to PD(L)-1 blockade, particularly in patients with tumors harboring an immune excluded phenotype (i.e., CD8+ T cells present in nearby stroma but excluded from the tumor parenchyma).

We estimate at least 750,000 cancer patients in the U.S. are eligible for treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapies every year, of which the majority of patients will develop progression to the treatment. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;">Increased signaling by TGF&#946;1 is a key driver of a number of disease-relevant processes, including immune system evasion by cancer cells, bone marrow fibrosis associated with hematological disorders, and tissue and organ fibrosis. Historically, selectively targeting TGF&#946;1 signaling has been challenging due to the inability of either small molecule inhibitors or antibodies to avoid off-target inhibition of other, closely related growth factors, TGF&#946;2 and TGF&#946;3. Treatment of animals with these non-selective TGF&#946; inhibitors has been associated with a range of toxicities, most notably cardiac toxicity. Furthermore, since each of these growth factors signals through the same TGF&#946; receptor, ALK5, inhibitors of the TGF&#946; receptor kinase suffer from similar dose-limiting toxicities. In preclinical studies of our antibodies, we have observed selective inhibition of TGF&#946;1 activation in vitro and immunomodulatory and antifibrotic activity in multiple disease models in vivo. A 28-day pilot nonclinical toxicology study in rats of our leading antibody did not observe any drug-related toxicity up to the highest dose (100 mg/kg weekly) tested in the study. In the same study, we tested non-selective TGF&#946; inhibitors and observed the published toxicities, including cardiac toxicity as well as death. We have also completed four-week GLP toxicology studies in rats and non-human primates and no SRK-181 related adverse effects were observed up to the highest evaluated dose of 200 mg/kg per week and 300 mg/kg per week, respectively.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">In many human cancers, TGF&#946; signaling is associated with lack of response to PD-(L)1 blockade, particularly in patients with tumors harboring an immune excluded phenotype (i.e., CD8+ T cells present in nearby stroma but excluded from the tumor parenchyma). We have observed multiple mouse models that recapitulate the immune-excluded phenotype and are resistant to PD-1 blockade become responsive to the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1, the murine analog of SRK-181, and an anti- PD-1 antibody. These models, including the MBT-2 bladder cancer model, the Cloudman S91 melanoma model and the EMT6 breast cancer model, were poorly responsive or unresponsive to single agent treatment </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">24</p></div></div>

However, in representative experiments, the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1 and anti-PD-1 resulted in tumor regressions of 72%, 57% and 70% in these three mouse models, respectively. Furthermore, the combination treatment led to statistically significant survival benefit in all three models (See &#8220;Preclinical Evidence in Overcoming Resistance to Checkpoint Inhibition&#8221;).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;">Our Phase 1 DRAGON clinical trial is intended to initially evaluate our therapeutic hypothesis that SRK-181 in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy may overcome resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and lead to anti-tumor responses. This clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors is ongoing and investigates the safety, PK and efficacy of SRK-181. The DRAGON trial consists of two parts: Part A (dose escalation of SRK-181 as a single-agent or in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy) and Part B (dose expansion evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy). Part B encompasses five active cohorts, including urothelial carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and commenced in 2021 and completed enrollment in December 2023. Safety, efficacy and biomarker data were presented in November 2023 at the SITC 38th Annual Meeting. Data presented continues to support proof-of-concept for SRK-181 in 28 heavily pretreated patients with ccRCC resistant to anti-PD-1. SRK-181 was generally well tolerated and showed promising anti-tumor activity in this patient population. Of 28 evaluable patients in the ccRCC cohort, six patients treated with SRK-181 in combination with pembrolizumab had confirmed partial responses (&#8220;PRs&#8221;) and achieved a best tumor reduction of 33% to 93%, with an objective response rate of 21.4%. In the biomarker analysis for ccRCC, levels of circulating granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (&#8220;gMDSC&#8221;) correlated with clinical activity in ccRCC patients treated with SRK-181 in combination with pembrolizumab. Safety data from ccRCC cohort continue to show SRK-181 is generally well tolerated.

It is characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the affected tissue and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality. TGF&#946; signaling pathway is a well-established central driver in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases and inhibition of this pathway has been shown to improve outcomes in relevant animal models of hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and other fibrotic diseases. In addition, a non-selective inhibitor of TGF&#946; signaling that inhibits all 3 isoforms (isoform 1, 2, and 3) of TGF&#946; showed clinical improvement in patients with systemic sclerosis, a fibrotic connective tissue disease. However, non-selective inhibition of all TGF&#946; isoforms is known to be associated with serious safety findings, most notably bleeding episodes, and cardiac toxicities. Based on knock out animal models (a model where researchers have inactivated, or "knocked out," an existing gene by replacing it or disrupting it with an artificial piece of DNA), these safety findings are believed to be associated with inhibition of the TGF&#946;2, and TGF&#946;3 isoforms. These data suggest that novel approaches to targeting TGF&#946; signaling may have broad applicability to the treatment of fibrotic disease, where more selective approaches may offer an improved safety profile. In addition, given that immune cell activation may play a key role in fibrotic disease development, selective targeting of only matrix associated TGF&#946;1, at the primary site of fibrosis manifestation, while avoiding immune cell associated TGF&#946;1 is key to maintaining efficacy while avoiding potential long-term liabilities of immune cell activation.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Based on this scientific rationale, we utilized our platform to discover and develop antibodies that selectively inhibit the activation of latent TGF&#946;1 in the context of fibrotic extracellular matrix and that avoid perturbing TGF&#946;1 presented by cells of the immune system.

These imbalances in iron levels can lead to detrimental complications and are the basis of mortalities and morbidities in many diseases. Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that is produced in the liver and plays a major role in regulating systemic iron homeostasis. Aberrantly increased hepcidin expression is a hallmark of several chronic and devastating diseases where it causes iron-restricted anemia, contributing to the morbidity and mortality of these diseases. Hepcidin expression is controlled via the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, with BMP2/6 being the predominant ligands signaling through a large protein receptor complex containing BMP receptors (BMPR) and a BMP co-receptor, repulsive guidance molecule c/ hemojuvelin (RGMc/HJV). The RGM family consists of three members, RGMa, RGMb and RGMc/HJV, and owing to their role as BMP co-receptors, has been shown to be involved in the development and maintenance of many tissues and organs throughout the body.

Intellectual Property Protection</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-bottom:14pt;background:#ffffff;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties, may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. As mentioned above, two granted patents, EP2981822 and EP3368069, are the subject of ongoing opposition proceedings before the EPO, as of December 31, 2023. While there are no contested proceedings or third-party claims relating to any of the other patents described above, as of that date, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not have such proceedings or third-party claims at a later date.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-bottom:14pt;background:#ffffff;margin:0pt;">The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20&#160;years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14&#160;years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic or provide an additional period of protection for the approved pharmaceutical product following expiry of the patent. In the future, if our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the U.S. and the national patent offices in Europe, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;background:#ffffff;margin:0pt;">In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates and research programs, we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. For example, certain elements of our proprietary platform may be based on unpatented trade secrets that are not publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations, and our advice for best practices, in protecting our trade secrets.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">32</p></div></div>

Certain antibody discovery and optimization vendors require us to enter into a license with them for the right to use antibodies discovered by them in humans or for commercial purposes. Such license could include substantial milestone payments and royalties to the extent we choose to use an antibody discovered by such vendor. On March 12, 2019, we exercised an option to receive such a license from Adimab pursuant to our Adimab Agreement.

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30&#160;days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.

Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (&#8220;DSMB&#8221;) or committee. The DSMB provides recommendations for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">iii.

Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product&#8217;s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the U.S.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#8220;PDUFA&#8221;) as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60&#160;days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file (&#8220;RTF&#8221;) by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10&#160;months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an Approval Letter or a Complete Response Letter. An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The Approval Letter may also include post-marketing requirements or commitments, such as the conduct of additional clinical trials or CMC studies. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase&#160;3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">iv.  Orphan Drug Designation</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">37</p></div></div>

Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a product designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:9.35pt;text-indent:-9.35pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">v.  Rare Pediatric Disease Designation</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The FDA grants Rare Pediatric Disease designation for serious and life-threatening diseases that primarily affect children ages 18 years or younger and fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Eligibility for a priority review voucher may be issued upon approval of a BLA or New Drug Application for therapies developed to treat such rare pediatric diseases. Priority review vouchers may be redeemed to obtain priority review for any subsequent marketing application or be sold or transferred.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">vi.  Expedited Development and Review Programs</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for Fast Track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. Accelerated approval may also be granted in the case that there are no alternative treatments available. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (&#8220;IMM&#8221;), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials with due diligence and, under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (&#8220;FDORA&#8221;), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after, the date accelerated approval is granted. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA currently requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a product or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">38</p></div></div>

Pediatric Information</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (&#8220;PREA&#8221;), as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submits an initial Pediatric Study Plan (&#8220;PSP&#8221;) within 60&#160;days of an end-of-Phase&#160;2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase&#160;3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">viii.  Post-marketing Requirements</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">39</p></div></div>

Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">ix.

Our future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In particular, the research of our product candidates, as well as the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. In the U.S., these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">The Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for among other things, any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.

In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, amendment to the CCPA was passed in November 2020, and as of January 1, 2023 has imposed additional obligations on companies covered </span></td></tr></table></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">41</p></div></div>

The CPRA significantly modified the CCPA, including by expanding consumers&#8217; rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information.

Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country would make our compliance obligations more complex and costly and may increase the likelihood that we may be subject to enforcement actions or otherwise incur liability for noncompliance. There are also states that are specifically regulating health information. For example, Washington state recently passed a health privacy law that will regulate the collection and sharing of health information, and the law also has a private right of action, which further increases the relevant compliance risk. Connecticut and Nevada have also passed similar laws regulating consumer health data. In addition, other states have proposed and/or passed legislation that regulates the privacy and/or security of certain specific types of information. For example, a small number of states have passed laws that regulate biometric data specifically. These various privacy and security laws may impact our business activities, including our identification of research subjects, relationships with business partners and ultimately the marketing and distribution of our products. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in the U.S. Congress of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we may likely become subject, if enacted.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees and engaging consultants and legal advisors, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, utilize management&#8217;s time and/or divert resources from other initiatives and projects. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or other third parties, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, injunctions, penalties or judgments. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of drugs from participation in state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time and resource consuming and can divert a company&#8217;s attention from the business.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">xi.

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our current product candidates and any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments. The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14&#160;years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (&#8220;BPCI Act&#8221;). This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">A reference biological product is granted 12&#160;years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. &#8220;First licensure&#8221; typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the U.S. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods for all formulations, dosage forms, and indications of the biologic. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a trial.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 54pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;white-space:pre-wrap;">b.

Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. The transitory provisions of the Clinical Trial Regulation provide that, by January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials must have transitioned to the Clinical Trials Regulation.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In the EU the Paediatric Committee (&#8220;PDCO&#8221;) of the EMA must approve a pediatric investigation plan (&#8220;PIP&#8221;) prior to an applicant filing a marketing authorization application (&#8220;MAA&#8221;), unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver or a class waiver. The PIP outlines the pharmaceutical company&#8217;s strategy for investigation of the new medicinal product in the pediatric population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines whether companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the EC, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of any supplementary protection certificate (&#8220;SPC&#8221;), provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">i.  European Union Expedited Review and Development</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">PRIME is a scheme provided by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation where the MAA will be made through the centralized procedure. To qualify for PRIME, product candidates require early clinical evidence that the therapy has the potential to offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefits patients without treatment options. Products from small-and medium-sized enterprises (&#8220;SMEs&#8221;) may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Among the benefits of PRIME are the appointment of a rapporteur to provide continuous support and help build knowledge ahead of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process. The receipt of PRIME designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Where, during the course of development, a product no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">ii.  European Union Drug Marketing</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the U.S., the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or reward improper performance generally is typically governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed.

European Union Drug Review and Approval</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization (&#8220;MA&#8221;). There are two types of MAs.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Centralized MAs, which are issued by the EC through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (&#8220;CHMP&#8221;) of the EMA, are valid throughout the EU, and in the additional Member States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) of the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (i.e., gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU Member States and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU Member State, this national MA can be recognized in another Member State through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference Member State (&#8220;RMS&#8221;). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (&#8220;SmPC&#8221;), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e.,&#160;in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">iv.  European Union Data and Market Exclusivity</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products from referencing the innovator&#8217;s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11&#160;years if, during the first eight years of those 10&#160;years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">48</p></div></div>

European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">In the EU, after a recommendation from the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (&#8220;COMP&#8221;), the European Commission may grant orphan designation to a product if (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by that condition. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10&#160;years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval during which time no &#8220;similar medicinal product&#8221; may be placed on the market. A &#8220;similar medicinal product&#8221; is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable so as not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. We will be required to apply for the maintenance of the orphan designation granted to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA at the time of applying for an MA.

Reform of the Regulatory Framework in the European Union</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">The European Commission introduced legislative proposals in April 2023 that, if implemented, will replace the current regulatory framework in the EU for all medicines (including those for rare diseases and for children). The European Commission has provided the legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the European Council for their review and approval. In October 2023, the European Parliament published draft reports proposing amendments to the legislative proposals, which will be debated by the European Parliament. Once the European Commission&#8217;s legislative proposals are approved (with or without amendment), they will be adopted into EU law.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">vii.  European General Data Protection Regulation</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Since we conduct clinical trials in the EEA, we are subject to additional European data privacy laws. The General Data Protection Regulation, (EU) 2016/679 (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), became effective on May 25, 2018, and deals with the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal data (such as health and other sensitive data,) relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the EEA, including to the U.S., providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information, responding to individuals&#8217; requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information, reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments, and record-keeping. The GDPR increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of our total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Given the limited enforcement of the GDPR to date, we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on our trials </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">49</p></div></div>

Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">National laws of member states of the EU are in the process of being adapted to the requirements under the GDPR, thereby implementing national laws which may partially deviate from the GDPR and impose different obligations from country to country, so that we do not expect to operate in a uniform legal landscape in the EEA. Also, as it relates to processing and transfer of genetic data, the GDPR specifically allows national laws to impose additional and more specific requirements or restrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional uncertainty. In addition, further to the UK&#8217;s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK&#8217;s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK&#8217;s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU&#8217;s data protection regime. The UK has announced plans to reform the country&#8217;s data protection legal framework in its Data Reform Bill, but these have been put on hold. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to &#163;17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU&#8217;s GDPR, the EC has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In the event we continue to conduct clinical trials in the EEA, we must also ensure that we maintain adequate safeguards to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA, in particular to the U.S., in compliance with European data protection laws. In the past, companies in the U.S. were able to rely upon the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework to legitimize data transfers from the EU the U.S. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (&#8220;CJEU&#8221;) in Case C-311/18 (Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems [&#8220;Schrems II&#8221;]) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on the grounds that the Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal data transferred to the U.S. The CJEU, in the same decision, deemed that the Standard Contractual Clauses (&#8220;SCCs&#8221;) published by the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;) are valid. However, the CJEU ruled that transfers made pursuant to the SCCs need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to ensure the law in the recipient country provides &#8220;essentially equivalent&#8221; protections to safeguard the transferred personal data as the EU, and required businesses to adopt supplementary measures if such standard is not met. Subsequent guidance published by the European Data Protection Board in June 2021 described what such supplementary measures must be, and stated that businesses should avoid or cease transfers of personal data if, in the absence of supplementary measures, equivalent protections cannot be afforded. On June 4, 2021, the EC issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that were adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the EC&#8217;s new standard contractual clauses but has published a draft version of a UK-specific transfer mechanism, which, once finalized, will enable transfers from the UK. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost. On March 25, 2022, the EC and the U.S. announced to have reached a political agreement on a new &#8220;Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework&#8221;, which will replace the invalidated Privacy Shield and on December 13, 2022, the EC published a draft adequacy decision on the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 54pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;white-space:pre-wrap;">c.

There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement (&#8220;TCA&#8221;), which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations.

The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently aligns in many respects with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in the future now that Great Britain&#8217;s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. Notwithstanding that there is no wholesale recognition of EU pharmaceutical legislation under the TCA, under a new international recognition procedure which was put in place by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (&#8220;MHRA&#8221;), the UK medicines regulator, on January 1, 2024, the MHRA may take into account decisions on the approval of an MA from the EMA (and certain other regulators) when considering an application for a Great Britain MA.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">On February 27, 2023, the UK government and the European Commission announced a political agreement in principle to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol with a new set of arrangements, known as the &#8220;Windsor Framework&#8221;. This new framework fundamentally changes the existing system under the Northern Ireland Protocol, including with respect to the regulation of medicinal products in the UK. In particular, the MHRA will be responsible for approving all medicinal products destined for the UK market (i.e., Great Britain and Northern Ireland), and the EMA will no longer have any role in approving medicinal products destined for Northern Ireland. A single UK-wide MA will be granted by the MHRA for all medicinal products to be sold in the UK, enabling products to be sold in a single pack and under a single authorization throughout the UK. The Windsor Framework was approved by the EU-UK Joint Committee on March 24, 2023, so the UK government and the EU will enact legislative measures to bring it into law. On June 9, 2023, the MHRA announced that the medicines aspects of the Windsor Framework will apply from January 1, 2025.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 99.35pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;white-space:pre-wrap;">i.

However, the MHRA published details of its legislative proposals designed to improve and strengthen the UK clinical trials legislation on March 21, 2023. The legislative proposals were published in response to a consultation which ran from January 17, 2022 until March 14, 2022.

There is now no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the EU) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an application for a UK or Great Britain MA. The criteria for orphan designation remain the same as in the EU, except that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in Great Britain, as opposed to the EU).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 54pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;white-space:pre-wrap;">d.

Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 54pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;white-space:pre-wrap;">e.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">51</p></div></div>

In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA&#8217;s accounting provisions.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:36pt;padding:0pt;">XIII.</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><b style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:bold;">Coverage and Reimbursement</b></td></tr></table><div style="margin-top:12pt;"></div><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor&#8217;s determination that use of a product is (i) a covered benefit under its health plan; (ii) safe, effective and medically necessary; (iii) appropriate for the specific patient; (iv) cost-effective; and (v) neither experimental nor investigational. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In the U.S. no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs or biological products exists, and one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. The level of coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One payor&#8217;s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. The coverage determination process may be a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">A third-party payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and payors, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company&#8217;s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time.

For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the &#8220;MMA&#8221;) established the Medicare Part&#160;D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part&#160;D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that prescription drug coverage. Part&#160;D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part&#160;D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Although Part&#160;D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part&#160;D drugs, not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class must be included. Any formulary used by a Part&#160;D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part&#160;D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part&#160;B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#8217;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low priced and high priced member states, can further reduce prices. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">53</p></div></div>

Employees</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As of March 1, 2024, we had 150 full-time employees, of which 111 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 39 are engaged in general and administrative activities. All of our employees are based in the U.S. and a majority are based in Massachusetts. In May 2022, we experienced a reduction in workforce in which 39 positions were impacted. After the reduction in 2022, we continued to make targeted hires to enhance our capabilities. The new employees were hired to support a variety of functions and key initiatives, including strengthening our clinical development, with hires in various areas of clinical development and operations. We anticipate continuing to add depth and new capabilities in key areas of our business. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 54pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;white-space:pre-wrap;">b.  Career Development and Growth</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We emphasize employee development and training. To empower employees to unleash their potential individually and as a team, we invest in our employees by providing development opportunities, and the necessary resources to support their success, including coaching, management and leadership training, presentation workshops and paid conference attendance. The diversity of our employees and their skillsets also offers a unique opportunity for us to learn from each other&#8217;s experiences.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 54pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;white-space:pre-wrap;">c.  Compensation and Benefits</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Our competitive compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. We provide employee salaries that are competitive within our industry based on position, skill level, experience and knowledge. Additionally, we offer equity to each of our employees to align the interests of our employees with the company&#8217;s mission.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of the benefits we offer are: medical insurance including prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, accident insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, wellness programs, access to mental health support and benefits, identity theft insurance and pet insurance.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 54pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;white-space:pre-wrap;">d.  Employee Engagement</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">We routinely conduct confidential employee engagement surveys to obtain feedback on a variety of topics, including culture, values, diversity, equity and inclusion, career development, employee satisfaction and tenure, and execution of our company strategy. These survey results are reviewed by our executive team so that we can continue to increase employee satisfaction and improve the well-being of our employees.<span style="font-size:12pt;"> </span>We value and encourage fostering mechanisms and opportunities for two-way dialogue. We actively strive to operationalize feedback provided by employees in ways that align with our business and culture. We are also committed to communication and transparency, using multiple forums and channels to allow for the sharing of appropriate, timely information to all employees.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">54</p></div></div>

What we have seen as a result of the pandemic is that flexibility is top of mind and a key consideration. We continue to offer daily onsite testing and masks at no cost to our employees and visitors and when necessary, conduct internal contact tracing. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">The need to provide the flexibility to work from home has refocused our work model. We&#8217;ve helped employees set up home offices, provided them access to tools to perform their jobs remotely, provided ergonomic assessments of their working environments, and helped them address IT connectivity. We&#8217;ve also found ways to continue to foster collaboration and community through events like virtual trivia nights, scavenger hunts, coffee chats, charitable giving and lunch-n-learns, that we would normally do in person.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 54pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;white-space:pre-wrap;">f.

Investing in meaningful DE&amp;I work enhances culture and employee experience. We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and safe work environment. As we grow and mature, we look forward to establishing programs that infuse DE&amp;I within the business, identify barriers that impact recruitment, development, and retention of underrepresented employees, identify educational content, communicate the value and impact of DE&amp;I on goals and objectives, all while continuing to focus on hiring diverse talent at all levels of the company. Our ability to innovate and meet people&#8217;s needs is strongest when all voices are heard and valued.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-size:1pt;visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">XV.</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><b style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:bold;">Facilities</b></td></tr></table><div style="margin-top:12pt;"></div><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Our corporate headquarters and operations are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In March 2015, we entered into a lease of laboratory and office space at 620 Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

limit market acceptance of our product candidates. For example, we anticipate some of our future trials to, in part, utilize an open-label trial design, and our ongoing Phase 1 DRAGON clinical trial for SRK-181 in cancer immunotherapy and our ongoing ONYX long-term extension study for apitegromab in patients from both the TOPAZ and SAPPHIRE trials, utilize an open-label trial design. An open-label trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the test article or either an existing approved drug or placebo. Open-label trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label studies are aware that they are receiving treatment. Open-label trials may be subject to a patient bias, for example, if patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. Open-label trials also may be subject to an investigator bias where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The potential sources of bias in clinical trials as a result of open-label design may not be adequately mitigated and may cause any of our trials that utilize </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">59</p></div></div>

Furthermore, we are conducting clinical trials with apitegromab in SMA, but by using apitegromab in a Phase 2 obesity clinical trial, we may become aware of safety information associated with apitegromab that we did not observe when we used apitegromab in our clinical trials in SMA. We, the FDA, the competent authorities and/or ethics committees of the EU Member States or other applicable regulatory authorities for their jurisdictions, or an IRB for their site(s) may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects or patients in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in clinical testing or marketing approvals.

Patients in our Phase 3 SAPPHIRE clinical trial, and ONYX, our long-term extension study for patients from both the TOPAZ and SAPPHIRE studies, are receiving apitegromab in conjunction with an approved SMN therapy. These patients are reliant on the continued use and availability of such therapies. If access to an approved SMN therapy such as nusinersen or risdiplam becomes limited or is unavailable, we may be forced to pause or stop our SAPPHIRE or ONYX long-term extension trials, or the medical condition of patients may be affected which could negatively affect the efficacy and safety results for apitegromab in the trials or reduce the amount of data or confound the data from these trials. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab in combination with approved GLP-1 RA in obesity. This study will rely upon the continued availability of such GLP-1 RA. Access to approved GLP-1 RAs are limited for use in clinical trials and may continue to be limited for such use. If GLP-1 RAs become more limited or unavailable, we may be unable to enroll, or may be delayed in enrolling patients, or may be forced to stop our Phase 2 study. While we have obtained substantial supply of an approved GLP-1 RA for use in this Phase 2 study, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate supply for future studies of our product candidate in obesity. Patients in Part B of our ongoing Phase 1 DRAGON clinical trial of SRK-181 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies are receiving SRK-181 in conjunction with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy such as pembrolizumab. If access to the approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy becomes limited or is unavailable, we may not be able to enroll, or may be delayed in enrolling patients or may be forced to pause or stop our Phase 1 DRAGON clinical trial, or the medical condition of patients may be affected which could negatively affect the efficacy and safety results for SRK-181 in the trial.

We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for apitegromab in healthy adult volunteers and we completed the treatment period of our Phase 2 TOPAZ clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA. In June 2023, we announced data from the Phase 2 TOPAZ trial extension period evaluating patient outcomes at 36 months of treatment with apitegromab. These data show that continued treatment with apitegromab over the extended period was associated with substantial and sustained improvement in motor function, and patient-reported outcomes in patients with nonambulatory Types 2 and 3 SMA receiving SMN therapy. Results on safety, efficacy and patient-reported outcomes such as fatigue, mobility and activities of daily living from TOPAZ were presented at the 2023 Cure SMA Research &amp; Clinical Care Meeting. In January 2022, we initiated our Phase 3 SAPPHIRE clinical trial of apitegromab for the treatment of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA and in September 2023, we announced completion of trial enrollment. We expect the top-line data readout for the SAPPHIRE trial in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also announced in October 2023 our plans to expand into cardiometabolic disorders based on preclinical data with SRK-439, and our intent to initiate a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab in combination with a GLP-1 receptor agonist in obesity in mid-2024 with data readout expected in mid-2025. We cannot assure you that the Phase 3 SAPPHIRE clinical trial or any other future clinical trials of apitegromab, such as our planned Phase 2 clinical trial in obesity, or of SRK-439 will show positive results. Additionally, product candidates evaluated in one disease indication may interact in unforeseen or harmful ways in a patient population with a different disease indication than was previously studied. For example, we are evaluating apitegromab in SMA, and plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of apitegromab in obesity. Apitegromab may interact in unforeseen or different ways in the obesity population than in the SMA patient population. There can be no assurance that any of our current or planned clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our product candidates. There can also be no assurance that any of our future clinical trials will show similar results to our earlier clinical trials or support further development or registration of any of our product candidates. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Interim, initial, or preliminary results from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change (e.g. from positive safety or efficacy results to poor or negative safety or efficacy results) as more patient data become available and are subject to additional audit, validation and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">From time to time, we may publish interim, initial, or preliminary data, including interim top-line results or initial or preliminary results from our clinical trials. Any interim, initial or preliminary data and other results from our clinical trials may materially change as more patient data become available. Preliminary, initial, interim or top-line results also remain subject to audit, validation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the interim, initial or preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim, initial or preliminary data may not be predictive of final results and should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. We may also arrive at different conclusions, or considerations may qualify such results, once we have received and fully evaluated additional data. For example, clinical data from Part A and Part B of our Phase 1 DRAGON trial in cancer immunotherapy, including preliminary safety and efficacy results, were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Targeted Anticancer Therapies Congress in March 2023. Safety, efficacy and biomarker data were presented in November 2023 at the SITC 38th Annual Meeting, and we will continue to present data from our Phase 1 DRAGON trial while the trial is ongoing. Tumor response data is based on assessments by site investigators. Central reads for the tumor responses are also being conducted, with a comprehensive review of the central reads to be performed once completed within and/or across the cohorts. Differences between preliminary, initial or interim data and final data could adversely affect our business.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologics proceeding through clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical development even after achieving promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Many drugs have failed to replicate efficacy and safety results in larger or more complex later stage trials. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain regulatory approval. If we fail to produce positive results in our ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials in apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439 or if a regulatory authority interprets and analyzes the results as not positive, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, may be materially adversely affected.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">61</p></div></div>

We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in civil monetary penalties, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. The FDA and National Institutes of Health have signaled the government&#8217;s willingness to begin enforcing these registration and reporting requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations would delay the regulatory approval process.

The third party CROs and clinical trial sites that conduct our clinical trials have experienced staffing shortages and the inability of a CRO or clinical trial site to maintain appropriate levels of competent staffing to support the demands of our clinical trials could negatively impact the execution of our clinical trials. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the preclinical or clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our development timelines, including clinical development timelines, may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, receive regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">If any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or others terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or other third parties or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO begins work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">63</p></div></div>

If we are unable to establish these commercial capabilities and infrastructure in a timely manner or to enter into agreements with third parties to market, sell, and/or distribute apitegromab if approved, we may be unable to complete a successful commercial launch. To the extent we enter into agreements with third parties, the revenue we receive may depend upon the efforts of such third parties, over which we may have limited or no control, and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized the products ourselves.

The FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials, the results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or amount of data required for approval, we may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates&#8217; clinical and other benefits outweigh their safety risks, or may disagree with our analysis or interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials. A BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls for the product, and the manufacturing facilities must complete a successful pre-license inspection as well as certain key clinical sites conducting our clinical trials.

Further, even if we receive orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition during the exclusivity period because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition, and the same product can be approved for different uses. Also, in the U.S., even after an orphan drug is approved and receives orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA may subsequently approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the latter drug is not the same drug, including because it has been shown to be clinically superior to the drug with exclusivity because it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.

If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Even if we receive regulatory approval of any product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">If any of our product candidates are approved, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including requirements related to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, import, export, conduct of post-marketing studies and submission of safety, efficacy and other post-marketing information. In addition, we will be subject to continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Manufacturers and manufacturers&#8217; facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, EU and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations. As such, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to periodic review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any BLA or other marketing application and previous responses to inspection observations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also require a REMS program as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could entail requirements for long-term patient follow-up, a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program.

There are many public and private companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. If we are successful in developing apitegromab, it is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products candidates or targeting similar indications will increase. Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. We expect competition in the indications we are pursuing will focus on efficacy, safety, convenience, availability, and price. The commercial opportunity for apitegromab, if approved, could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are perceived to be safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than apitegromab. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Preclinical development is uncertain.

As a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs or similar applications for the clinical development of our preclinical programs, such as our potential IND for SRK-439, on the timelines we expect, if at all, and we cannot be sure that submission of INDs or similar applications will result in the FDA, the competent authorities and/or ethics committees in the EU Member States or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Conducting preclinical testing can be a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process.

We do not own our own manufacturing facilities for producing any clinical trial or commercial product supplies. There can be no assurance that our preclinical, clinical development, and, if approved, commercial product supplies will not be limited or interrupted due to impacts to our third-party contract manufacturers. For example, we rely on a single source supplier for the manufacture of apitegromab and SRK-181. Any replacement of our current drug substance contract manufacturer or drug product contract manufacturer would require significant resources, lead time and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements. In addition, our ability to procure sufficient supplies for the development of apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439 or future product candidates could be impacted by factors outside of our control such as current macroeconomic and geopolitical events and the changing rates of inflation and interest rates. In addition, we have no direct control over our contract manufacturers&#8217; ability to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Furthermore, all of our third-party contract manufacturers supply and/or manufacture materials or products for other companies, which exposes our third-party contract manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products.

In the event that any of our manufacturers fails to comply with such requirements or to perform its obligations to us in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we currently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with another third-party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty transferring such skills or technology to another third-party and a feasible alternative may not exist. These factors would increase our reliance on the original manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have another third-party manufacture our product candidates. If we must change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. We will also need to verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product candidate according to the specifications previously submitted to the FDA or another regulatory authority. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies of drug substance, drug product, and packaged and labeled product for apitegromab, if we receive regulatory approval. We will also rely on our contract manufacturers to manufacture sufficient quantities of apitegromab to produce validation batches. We do not have long-term supply agreements in place with any of our contract manufacturers, and each batch of our product candidates is individually contracted through a purchase order governed by master service and quality agreements. If our existing contract manufacturers for our product candidates are not willing to enter into long-term supply agreements, or are not willing or are unable to supply product candidate supplies to us, we could be required to engage new contract manufacturers who would need to scale up the manufacturing process before we would be able to use the product candidate supplies they manufacture, which could result in delays to our clinical trials or future commercialization plans, if we are successful and gain approval.</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">70</p></div></div>

In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our CROs and collaborators. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by HITECH. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Compliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals&#8217; privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We have conducted our Phase 2 TOPAZ clinical trial of apitegromab in the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;), are conducting our Phase 3 SAPPHIRE clinical trial and ONYX, our long-term extension clinical trial of apitegromab, in the EEA and the UK, and may conduct future clinical trials in the EEA or the UK and therefore may be subject to additional privacy laws. The EU GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal information relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the EEA or the UK, including to the U.S., providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information, responding to individuals&#8217; requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information, where required reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, where required, appointing data protection officers, where required conducting data protection impact assessments, and record-keeping. The EU GDPR imposes penalties in the event of non-compliance, including fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of our total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses. The EU GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the EU GDPR. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Further to the UK&#8217;s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the EU GDPR ceased to apply in the UK but the UK incorporated the EU GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK&#8217;s data protection regime, which is independent from but currently still aligned to the EU&#8217;s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to &#163;17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">75</p></div></div>

Likewise, personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing. The UK Government has introduced a Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (&#8220;UK Bill&#8221;) into the UK legislative process. The aim of the UK Bill is to reform the UK&#8217;s data protection regime following Brexit. If passed, the final version of the UK Bill may have the effect of further altering the similarities between the UK and EEA data protection regime and threaten the UK Adequacy Decision from the European Commission. This may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. The respective provisions and enforcement of the EU GDPR and UK GDPR may further diverge in the future and create additional regulatory challenges and uncertainties.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Adequate safeguards must be implemented to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA or the UK in compliance with European and UK data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission (EC) issued new forms of standard contractual clauses (&#8220;SCCs&#8221;) for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EEA (or otherwise subject to the EU GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EEA (and not subject to the EU GDPR). The new SCCs replace the SCCs that were adopted previously under the Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the EC&#8217;s new SCCs but has published its own standard clauses, the International Data Transfer Agreement, which enables transfers from the UK. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU GDPR and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost. Where relying on the SCCs or UK IDTA for data transfers, we may also be required to carry out transfer impact assessments to assess whether the recipient is subject to local laws which allow public authority access to personal data.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In July 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (&#8220;Framework&#8221;), the successor of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated in 2020. On the basis of the new adequacy decision, personal data can flow safely from the EU to U.S. companies participating in the Framework, without having to put in place additional data protection safeguards. However, the long term validity of the Framework, which has already been challenged in court, remains uncertain.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The EU GDPR and UK GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the EU GDPR and UK GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Given the new law, we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the law. Compliance with the EU GDPR and UK GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">EU Member States have adopted implementing national laws to implement the EU GDPR which may partially deviate from the EU GDPR and the competent authorities in the EU Member States may interpret EU GDPR obligations slightly differently from country to country, so that we do not expect to operate in a uniform legal landscape in the EU. Also, as it relates to processing and transfer of genetic data, the EU GDPR specifically allows national laws to impose additional and more specific requirements or restrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional uncertainty.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We expect that we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by a European or UK data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by European or UK data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products and solutions due to the potential risk exposure as a result of the current (and, in particular, future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the EU GDPR and UK GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical partners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">76</p></div></div>

Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Further, in some cases where we process sensitive and personal information of individuals from numerous states, we may find it necessary to comply with the most stringent state laws applicable to any of the information. For example, California&#8217;s California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), creates comprehensive individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. While there are currently exceptions for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), and other enacted or proposed comprehensive state consumer privacy legislation may impact our business activities. We continue to monitor the impact that the state consumer privacy and protection laws, like the CCPA, may have on our business activities.

If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to perceived or actual negative societal impact, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. The use of certain artificial intelligence technology can give rise to intellectual property risks, including compromises to proprietary intellectual property and intellectual property infringement. Additionally, we expect to see increasing government and supranational regulation related to artificial intelligence use and ethics, which may also significantly increase the burden and cost of research, development and compliance in this area. For example, the EU&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Act (&#8220;AI Act&#8221;) &#8212; the world&#8217;s first comprehensive AI law &#8212; is anticipated to enter into force in Spring 2024 and, with some exceptions, become effective 24 months thereafter. This legislation imposes significant obligations on providers and deployers of high risk artificial intelligence systems, and encourages providers and deployers of artificial intelligence systems to account for EU ethical principles in their development and use of these systems. If we develop or use AI systems that are governed by the AI Act, it may necessitate ensuring higher standards of data quality, transparency, and human oversight, as well as adhering to specific and potentially burdensome and costly ethical, accountability, and administrative requirements. The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence will require the application of significant resources to design, develop, test and maintain our service offerings to help ensure that artificial intelligence is implemented in accordance with applicable law and regulation and in a socially responsible manner and to minimize any real or perceived unintended harmful impacts. Our vendors may in turn incorporate artificial intelligence tools into their own offerings, and the providers of these artificial intelligence tools may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards, including with respect to privacy and data security. Further, bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of artificial intelligence, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information and intellectual property. Any of these effects could damage our reputation, result in the loss of valuable property and information, cause us to breach applicable laws and regulations, and adversely impact our business.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">77</p></div></div>

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA&#8217;s accounting provisions.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our research and development activities involve the use of biological and hazardous materials and produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Although we maintain workers&#8217; compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">78</p></div></div>

For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources.

Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or manmade accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, the facilities at any clinical trial site, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439 and future product candidates or interruption of our business operations. If a natural disaster, outbreak of disease, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our research facilities, our clinical trial sites or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Global events, including global health concerns could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we operate or where the third parties with whom we engage, including our clinical trial sites and manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, operate.

For example, we are conducting SAPPHIRE, our Phase 3 clinical trial and, ONYX, our long-term extension clinical trial of apitegromab in the U.S. and EU, and regional instability caused by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine could adversely affect the conduct of our clinical trials. Such conflicts could lead to sanctions, embargoes, supply shortages, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, cyberattacks, other retaliatory actions, and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates, and financial markets, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results, as well as those of third parties with whom we conduct business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event.

One payor&#8217;s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Coverage and reimbursement for products may vary widely across national payors from country to country.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive evidence generation studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such a product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to current standards of care, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to cover its costs or make a profit. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of product candidates. Patients are unlikely to use our product </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">81</p></div></div>

There is significant uncertainty related to insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures are expected to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the U.S. and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, cost containment initiatives and additional legislative changes.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">EU drug marketing and reimbursement regulations may materially affect our ability to market and receive coverage for our products in the European Member States.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions. If we receive approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions for apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439 or future product candidates, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some foreign countries, particularly those in the EU, the pricing of medicinal products is subject to governmental control and other market regulations which could put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receiving marketing approval of a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Much like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the U.S., the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-inducement, advertising and anti-bribery laws of EU Member States. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be disclosed publicly. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician&#8217;s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">In addition, in most foreign countries, including several EU Member States, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">82</p></div></div>

Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further reduce prices. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues from sales by us or our strategic partners and the potential profitability of any of our product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">We may seek to enter into collaborations in the future with third parties, including for apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439 or potential product candidates.

Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. If we are unable to secure and maintain patent protection for any product or technology we develop, or if the scope of the patent protection secured is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to commercialize any product candidates we may develop may be adversely affected. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The patenting process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all relevant markets. Unforeseen global events, and sanctions or actions relating to such events, could affect our ability to file, prosecute, maintain, and/or defend patents and applications in those markets. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and are reliant on our licensors or licensees. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the U.S. and/or in other foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, Russia issued a decree in March of 2022, stating that patent owners who reside in a country &#8220;unfriendly&#8221; to Russia are not entitled to compensation in the event of patent infringement. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property and/or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We cannot be certain that we are the first to invent the inventions covered by pending patent applications and, if we are not, we may be subject to priority disputes. We may be required to disclaim part or all of the term of certain patents or all of the term of certain patent applications. There may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim. There also may be prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim. No assurance can be given that if challenged, our patents would be declared by a court to be valid or enforceable or that even if found valid and enforceable, a competitor&#8217;s technology or product would be found by a court to infringe our patents.

The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent application process and following the issuance of a patent. While an inadvertent lapse can, in many cases, be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. Moreover, complications due to global pandemics may result in inadvertent lapse due to, for example, unexpected closures of the USPTO or foreign patent offices, delays in delivery of notifications relating to deadlines, or failure to timely and/or properly obtain signatures on necessary documents. Additionally, due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, there remain uncertainties as to any potential impact on patent protection and/or enforcement in the region, including, for example, payments to the Russian Patent Office and other entities.

Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In addition, recent or future patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. Under the enacted Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the &#8220;America Invents Act&#8221;), enacted in 2013, the U.S. moved from a &#8220;first to invent&#8221; to a &#8220;first to file&#8221; system. Under a &#8220;first to file&#8221; system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The America Invents Act includes a number of other significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and establish a new post-grant review system. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO only recently developed new regulations and procedures in connection with the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law, including the &#8220;first to file&#8221; provisions, only became effective in March 2013. In addition, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have also narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised eligibility and validity standards. Additionally, some of our owned or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in proceedings before the USPTO, or during litigation, under the revised criteria which could also make it more difficult to obtain patents.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the case Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi, the Federal Circuit held that a well characterized antigen is insufficient to satisfy the written description requirement of certain claims directed to a genus of antibodies that are solely defined by function. While the validity of a subset of patents at issue was subsequently upheld by a district court jury, uncertainty remains as to the legal question pertaining to the written description requirement under 35 USC &#167;112 as it relates to functional antibodies. In the case of Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable. We cannot predict how these decisions or any future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may impact the value of our patents. Similarly, any adverse changes in the patent laws of other jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For example, Russia issued a decree in March of 2022, stating that patent owners who reside in a country &#8220;unfriendly&#8221; to Russia are not entitled to compensation in the event of patent infringement.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">89</p></div></div>

There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation, inter partes review, post-grant review, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of drugs, products or their methods of use or manufacture. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates, technologies or methods.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">If a third-party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management&#8217;s attention from our core business;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product candidate or technology at issue infringes on or violates the third-party&#8217;s rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner&#8217;s attorneys&#8217; fees;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">a court prohibiting us from developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling our product candidates, or from using our proprietary technologies, unless the third-party licenses its product rights to us, which it is not required to do;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">if a license is available from a third-party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees and other amounts, and/or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products; and</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">redesigning our product candidates or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.</span></td></tr></table><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.

In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of our product candidates, constructs or molecules used in or formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our ability to commercialize our product candidates may be impaired or delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business. Even if we obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Parties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, and/or pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We may also choose to challenge the patentability of claims in a third-party&#8217;s U.S. patent by requesting that the USPTO review the patent claims in an ex-parte re-exam, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings. These proceedings are expensive and may consume our time or other resources. We may choose to challenge the grant of a third-party&#8217;s patent in opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office (&#8220;EPO&#8221;) or other foreign patent office. The costs of these opposition proceedings could be substantial, and may consume our time or other resources.

In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In some situations, we or our licensor, may not be able to detect infringement against our owned or in-licensed patents, as the case may be, which may be especially difficult for manufacturing processes or formulation patents. Even if we or our licensors detect infringement by a third-party of our owned or in-licensed patents, we or our licensors, as the case may be, may choose not to pursue litigation against or settlement with the third-party. If we, or our licensors, later sue such third-party for patent infringement, the third-party may have certain legal defenses available to it, which otherwise would not be available except for the delay between when the infringement was first detected and when the suit was brought. Such legal defenses may make it impossible for us or our licensors to enforce our owned or in-licensed patents, as the case may be, against such third-party.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Issued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or the USPTO.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third-party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the U.S. or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include inter parties review, ex parte re-examination, post-grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). For example, EP3368069 and EP2981822 are currently subject to opposition proceedings. Such proceedings are expensive and could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our rights, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In addition, because some patent applications in the U.S. may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in PCT member jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the earliest filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our owned and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications, or that we or, if applicable, a licensor were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our products, compositions, methods of use, or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our owned and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned by or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. If we or one of our licensors is a party to an interference proceeding involving a U.S. patent application on inventions owned by or in-licensed to us, we may incur substantial costs, divert management&#8217;s time and expend other resources, even if we are successful.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">92</p></div></div>

An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We have limited intellectual property rights outside the U.S. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Indeed, Russia issued a decree in March of 2022, stating that patent owners who reside in a country &#8220;unfriendly&#8221; to Russia are not entitled to compensation in the event of patent infringement. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products and/or methods of medical treatment, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products against third parties in violation of our proprietary rights generally. The initiation of proceedings by third parties to challenge the scope or validity of our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As another example, in Europe, a new unitary patent system became effective in June 2023, which may significantly impact European patents, including those granted before the introduction of such a system. Under the unitary patent system, European applications have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary Patent which will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Unitary Patent Court (&#8220;UPC&#8221;). As the UPC is a new court system, there is no precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. Subject to current transitional provisions, European patents have the option of opting out of the jurisdiction of the UPC and remaining as national patents in the UPC countries. Patents that remain under the jurisdiction of the UPC are potentially vulnerable to a single UPC-based revocation challenge that, if successful, could invalidate the patent in all countries who are signatories to the UPC. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">93</p></div></div>

In the U.S., if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions such as patent term adjustments and/or extensions, may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Action of 1984, also known as the Hatch Waxman Amendments. The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the BLA, plus the time between the date of submission of the BLA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, the patents protecting our product candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In addition to patent protection, we rely heavily upon know-how and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third-party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. If we choose to go to court to stop a third-party from using any of our trade secrets, we may incur substantial costs. These lawsuits may consume our time and other resources even if we are successful. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology.</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">94</p></div></div>

It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations, and our advice for best practices, in protecting our trade secrets.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Third parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used, disclosed, or misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, and although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and, if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. This type of litigation or proceeding could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we reported a net loss of $165.8 million and $134.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $676.4 million. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439, and any future product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">To become and remain profitable, we or any current or potential future collaborators must develop and eventually commercialize products with significant market potential and favorable pricing. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials, receiving marketing approval for product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling products for which we may receive marketing approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenue that is significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Even if we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders&#8217; equity and working capital.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">We will require additional capital to fund our operations and if we fail to obtain necessary capital, we will not be able to complete the development and commercialization of apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439 and any future product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of cash to conduct further research and development, including clinical trials for apitegromab and SRK-181 and preclinical studies and clinical trials for SRK-439 and any future product candidates, to seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates and to launch and commercialize any products for which we receive regulatory approval. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $279.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2025. However, our future capital requirements and the period for which our existing resources will support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect, and we will in any event require additional capital in order to complete clinical development of any of our current programs. Our monthly spending levels will vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities. Additionally, any program setbacks or delays due to changes in federal or state laws or clinical site or clinical vendor policies as a result of the impacts of current macroeconomic and geopolitical events, increasing rates of inflation and rising interest rates could impact our programs and increase our expenditures. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:</span></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:6pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">the initiation, progress, timing, completion, costs and results of clinical trials for apitegromab and SRK-181 and preclinical studies and clinical trials for SRK-439 and any future product candidates;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:6pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">the clinical development plans we establish for our product candidates;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:6pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">the number and characteristics of product candidates that we identify and develop;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:6pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">the terms of any collaboration, strategic alliance, or licensing agreements we are currently party to or may choose to enter into in the future;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:6pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"/><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA, the EMA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;</span></td></tr></table></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">96</p></div></div>

If we raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders&#8217; rights.

Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. For example, under Section 174 of the Code, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, expenses that are incurred for research and development in the U.S. will be capitalized and amortized, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form or with what effective dates tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued, which could result in an increase in our or our shareholders&#8217; tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law.

As of December 31, 2023, we also had available tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $40.8 million and $6.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2034 and 2024, respectively. Additionally, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 the deductibility of the indefinite lived federal net operating losses is limited to 80% of our taxable income in any future taxable year. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), changes in our ownership may limit the amount of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually to offset our future taxable income, if any. This limitation would generally apply in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Any such limitation may significantly reduce our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards before they expire. Private placements and other transactions that have occurred since our inception, as well as our IPO, may trigger such an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Code. Any such limitation, whether as the result of our IPO, prior private placements, sales of our common stock by our existing stockholders or additional sales of our common stock by us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future years. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (&#8220;SVB&#8221;) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. Since then, additional financial institutions have experienced similar failures and have been placed into receivership. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Inflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities with interest rates below current market interest rates. Although the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to $25 billion of loans to financial institutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of such instruments, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediate liquidity may exceed the capacity of such program. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure of other banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Although we assess our banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect the Company, the financial institutions with which the Company has credit agreements or arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which the Company has financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">98</p></div></div>

Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results of operations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In addition, any further deterioration in the macroeconomic economy or financial services industry could lead to losses or defaults by our suppliers, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial condition. For example, a supplier could be adversely affected by any of the liquidity or other risks that are described above as factors that could result in material adverse impacts on us, including but not limited to delayed access or loss of access to uninsured deposits or loss of the ability to draw on existing credit facilities involving a troubled or failed financial institution. Any supplier bankruptcy or insolvency, or any breach or default by a supplier, or the loss of any significant supplier relationships, could result in material losses to us and may have a material adverse impact on our business.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our current investment policy focuses on preservation of capital. However, we could recognize losses on securities held in our investment portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our cash equivalents and investments in our marketable debt securities portfolio was approximately $279.9 million and consisted primarily of investments in money market funds and U.S. government securities. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities or our own analysis of the value of the security, defaults by the issuer with respect to the underlying securities, and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">At December 31, 2023, we had one thousand in net unrealized losses in our marketable securities available-for-sale portfolio, and unrealized losses in our securities portfolio may increase in the future due to the aforementioned economic factors. While our goal is to hold each security until maturity, that may not be possible in light of our policy to preserve capital and liquidity and because investment in securities with unrealized losses has a diminished utility as a source of liquidity prior to maturity. Selling securities with an unrealized loss would result in the realization of such losses, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">99</p></div></div>

In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#8217;s securities.

These exemptions and reduced disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company also mean our auditors are not required to audit our internal control over financial reporting for so long as we report less than $100 million in annual revenues for the most recent fiscal year and may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.

Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the date we report at least $100 million in annual revenues and have a public float of at least $75 million for the most recent fiscal year or have a public float of at least $700 million for the most recent fiscal year. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction to the trading price of our common stock in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.

Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management will be required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221;, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. We will qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is below $250 million (or $700 million if our annual revenue is less than $100 million) as of June 30 in any given year. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could detect problems that our management&#8217;s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">We have broad discretion in the use of our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and may not use them effectively. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our management has broad discretion in the application of our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

In addition, our amended and restated bylaws contain a provision by virtue of which, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts will be the exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions, however, stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. We have chosen the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive forum for such causes of action because our principal executive offices are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some companies that have adopted similar federal district court forum selection provisions are currently subject to a suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware brought by stockholders who assert that the federal district court forum selection provision is not enforceable. While the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are &#8220;facially valid&#8221; under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our federal forum selection provision, and we may incur additional costs of litigation should such enforceability be challenged. If the federal forum selection provision is otherwise found inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We recognize that the federal district court forum selection clause may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert the provision is not enforceable and may impose more general additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Additionally, the choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We have issued a substantial number of warrants and equity awards from our equity plans which are exercisable into shares of our common stock which could result in substantial dilution to the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As of December 31, 2023, approximately 9,988,156 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise or conversion of outstanding warrants.

The number of shares that are sold by Jefferies after delivering a placement notice will fluctuate based on the market price of the common stock during the sales period and limits we set with Jefferies.

As a global leader in transforming growth factor beta (&#8220;TGF&#946;&#8221;) superfamily biology, our novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled us to develop a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors. By targeting the signaling proteins at the cellular level and acting in the disease microenvironment, we believe we may avoid the historical dose-limiting safety challenges associated with inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect. We believe our focus on biologically validated growth factors may facilitate a more efficient development path.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;background:#ffffff;margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">Based on this proprietary and scalable technology platform, we are building a growing portfolio of novel product candidates with the aim of transforming the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, cancer, fibrosis and iron-restricted anemia.

The Company has subsequently presented data from the TOPAZ trial over 24-months (June 2022) and 36-months (July 2023), which showed that continued treatment with apitegromab over the extended period was associated with substantial and sustained improvement in motor function, and patient-reported outcomes in patients with nonambulatory Types 2 and 3 SMA receiving an SMN therapy. The FDA granted fast track designation, rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA in May 2021, August 2020 and March 2018, respectively. The European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;) granted PRIME designation in March 2021 and the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;) granted orphan medicinal product designation in December 2018 to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">In October 2023, we announced an expansion of our therapeutic focus into cardiometabolic disorders by advancing our anti-myostatin program with SRK-439, a novel, fully human anti-myostatin monoclonal antibody, for evaluation in cardiometabolic disorders, including obesity. We are developing SRK-039 towards a potential IND submission in 2025. To inform the development of SRK-439, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in 2024 with data expected in mid-2025.&#160;</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:12pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:5pt;margin-top:5pt;visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Our second product candidate, SRK-181,<span style="background:#ffffff;"> a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent TGF&#946;,</span> is being developed for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to CPI therapies, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody therapies (referred to together as anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies). <span style="background:#ffffff;">SRK-181 was evaluated in our Phase 1 DRAGON proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies.

Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials, as well as the associated clinical trial material requirements. We expect research and development costs for our product candidates to continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future as the development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development.

To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, common stockholder ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of a common stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">117</p></div></div>

Market volatility or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting estimates are those most critical to the judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. They involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our finance condition or result of operations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Research and Development Expenses and related Accruals/Prepaids</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and/or reviewing other third-party sources to identify the progress of services that has been performed on our behalf, as well as invoices received and contracted costs. This contributes to estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. In certain instances, we prepay for services to be provided in the future. These amounts are expensed as the services are performed.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid balance accordingly.

To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts incurred. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The accrued research and development expenses at the end of each year are generally paid during the following year and therefore the same estimates and assumptions do not continue to exist each year, although, as described above, the method and procedures to develop those estimates and assumptions are generally consistent. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Revenue Recognition</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">No revenues have been recorded from the sale of any commercial product. Revenue generation activities have been limited to collaborations, containing research services and the issuance of a license. Prior to January 2022, revenue was being recognized related to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement which was executed in December 2018. We recognized associated revenue between 2019 and 2021 over the period that research was performed under the collaboration and recognized revenue attributable to the material rights provided by the options in January 2022. We account for revenue under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii) measurement of the transaction price, (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to our customer.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Identification of the Contract(s) with the Customer</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We account for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of ASC 606 when all of the following criteria are met: (i) the arrangement has been approved by the parties and the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, (ii) each party&#8217;s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iii) the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iv) the arrangement has commercial substance and (v) collection of substantially all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer is probable.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Identification of the Performance Obligations</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, we consider factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of our customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer&#8217;s discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying license relative to the option exercise price, including assumptions about technical feasibility and the probability of developing a candidate that would be subject to the option rights.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">119</p></div></div>

The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. We utilize either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We evaluate whether development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee&#8217;s control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenue and earnings in the period of adjustment. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">For sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, we determine whether the sole or predominant item to which the royalties relate is a license. When the license is the sole or predominant item to which the sales-based royalty relates, we recognize revenue at the later of: (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any sales-based royalty revenue resulting from our arrangement.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Allocation of Transaction Price</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We allocate the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price. We must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We utilize key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Estimating costs for research and development programs is subjective as we estimate the costs anticipated to successfully complete the research performance obligations. As the research is novel, efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs at the beginning of the contract. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts we would expect to receive for satisfying each performance obligation.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Recognition of Revenue</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We utilize judgment to determine whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. We determine the appropriate method of measuring progress performance obligations satisfied over time for purposes of recognizing revenue, such as by using an input method based on costs incurred compared to the costs expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy the performance obligation. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The estimated remaining costs is highly subjective, as the research is novel, therefore efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs made at the balance sheet date. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We receive payments from customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Up-front payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until we perform our obligations under these arrangements. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">120</p></div></div>

As a global leader in transforming growth factor beta (&#8220;TGF&#946;&#8221;) superfamily biology, the Company&#8217;s novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled the development of a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company&#8217;s first product candidate, apitegromab, is a highly selective, fully human, monoclonal antibody, with a unique mechanism of action that results in inhibition of the activation of the growth factor, myostatin, in skeletal muscle. Apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-targeted therapy for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (&#8220;SMA&#8221;). The Company is conducting SAPPHIRE, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apitegromab in patients with nonambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA. In 2023, the Company completed enrollment for the Phase 3 SAPPHIRE trial and announced data from the Phase 2 TOPAZ trial extension period evaluating patient outcomes at 36 months of treatment with apitegromab. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In October 2023, the Company announced plans to expand into cardiometabolic disorders and advance its anti-myostatin program with SRK-439, a novel, fully human anti-myostatin monoclonal antibody, for evaluation in cardiometabolic disorders, including obesity, towards a potential investigational new drug application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) submission in 2025. To inform the development of SRK-439, the Company plans to initiate a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab in combination with a GLP-1-receptor agonist in 2024. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company&#8217;s second product candidate, SRK-181, a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent transforming growth factor beta (&#8220;TGF&#946;&#8221;), is being developed for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitor (&#8220;CPI&#8221;) therapies, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody therapies (referred to together as anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies). SRK-181 was evaluated in the Company&#8217;s Phase 1 DRAGON proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies. The Phase 1 DRAGON trial completed enrollment in December 2023. This two-part clinical trial consists of a dose escalation portion (Part A) and a dose expansion evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD- (L)1 antibody therapy (Part B). Part B includes the following active cohorts: urothelial carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Safety, efficacy and biomarker data were presented in November 2023 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 38th Annual Meeting. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Additionally, the Company continues to create a pipeline of product candidates to deliver novel therapies to underserved patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, cancer, fibrosis, and iron-restricted anemia. The Company was originally formed in May 2012. Its principal offices are in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Since its inception, the Company&#8217;s operations have focused on research and development of monoclonal antibodies that selectively inhibit activation of growth factors for therapeutic effect, as well as establishing the Company&#8217;s intellectual property portfolio and performing research and development activities. The Company has primarily financed its operations through various equity financings, including in October 2023 (Note 9), as well as research and development collaboration agreements and the Company&#8217;s debt facility (Note 13).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Revenue generation activities have been limited to two collaborations, both containing research services and the issuance of a license. The first agreement, executed in 2013, was with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (&#8220;Janssen&#8221;), a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson and was terminated in July 2022.

No revenues have been recorded from the sale of any commercial product.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, successful discovery and development of its drug candidates, raising additional capital, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology and regulatory approval and market acceptance of the Company&#8217;s product candidates. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as it continues to develop its product candidates. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2023 will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operations through at least a period of one year after the date these financial statements are issued. </p><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2023_To_12_31_2023_ppNfvDwaGEqhEoehvLjPkg" name="us-gaap:BasisOfAccountingPolicyPolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_M0Ai9TMgnESH4dlUCMBMhw" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Basis of Presentation</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scholar Rock Holding Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Marketable securities with a remaining maturity date greater than one&#160;year are classified as non-current if the Company does not intend to utilize the marketable securities to fund current operations. Marketable securities are maintained by an investment manager and consist of U.S. treasury obligations and government agency securities. Marketable securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders&#8217; equity until realized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the underlying marketable security.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Although available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise, securities are generally held through maturity.

If the decline in fair value is due to credit loss factors, a loss is recognized in net income. To date, the Company has not experienced any credit losses and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these investments. </p></ix:nonNumeric><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2023_To_12_31_2023_ppNfvDwaGEqhEoehvLjPkg" name="us-gaap:PropertyPlantAndEquipmentPolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_DnpA6EvEXkm4lKTGWXmABg" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Property and Equipment</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Property and equipment are recorded at cost.

At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its estimated incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In accordance with the guidance in ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g. land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g. property taxes, insurance, etc.). Then the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. For operating leases, lease expense relating to fixed payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term and lease expense relating to variable payments is expensed as incurred.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2023_To_12_31_2023_ppNfvDwaGEqhEoehvLjPkg" name="us-gaap:FairValueOfFinancialInstrumentsPolicy" id="Tb_8m09WLPES0WcRPK_WIhAlA" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Fair Value Measurements</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ("ASC 820"), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company&#8217;s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company&#8217;s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. ASC 820 identifies fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between the following:</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:22.5pt;text-indent:-22.5pt;margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Level 1</b>&#160;<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&#8212;  Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:49.7pt;text-indent:-49.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.99pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Level 2</b>&#160;<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&#8212;  Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted market prices, interest rates and yield curves.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:49.7pt;text-indent:-49.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 35.99pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Level 3</b>&#160;<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&#8212;  Unobservable inputs developed using estimates of assumptions developed by the Company, which reflect those that a market participant would use.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair values requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized as Level 3. A financial instrument&#8217;s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2023_To_12_31_2023_ppNfvDwaGEqhEoehvLjPkg" name="us-gaap:SegmentReportingPolicyPolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_6wFvIJq1qkqrIUktirJxuw" continuedAt="Tb_6wFvIJq1qkqrIUktirJxuw_cont1" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Segment Information</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i)&#160;identification of the contract(s)&#160;with the customer, (ii)&#160;identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii)&#160;measurement of the transaction price, (iv)&#160;allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v)&#160;recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company accounts for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of ASC 606 when all of the following criteria are met: (i)&#160;the arrangement has been approved by the parties and the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, (ii)&#160;each party&#8217;s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iii)&#160;the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iv)&#160;the arrangement has commercial substance and (v)&#160;collection of substantially all of the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer is probable.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company first evaluates license and/or collaboration arrangements to determine whether the arrangement (or part of the arrangement) represents a collaborative arrangement pursuant to ASC Topic 808,&#160;<i style="font-style:italic;">Collaborative Arrangements,</i>&#160;based on the risks and rewards and activities of the parties pursuant to the contractual arrangement. The Company accounts for collaborative arrangements (or elements within the contract that are deemed part of a collaborative&#160;arrangement)<span style="background:#ffffff;">, which represent a collaborative relationship and not a customer relationship,</span>&#160;outside of the scope of ASC 606. The Company&#8217;s two collaborations represented revenue&#160;arrangements.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:2pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">For the arrangements or arrangement components that are subject to revenue accounting guidance, in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must use significant judgment to determine: a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract; b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and c) the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. The Company uses judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are&#160;satisfied. In determining the stand-alone selling price of a license to the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology or a material right provided by a customer option, the Company considers market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its estimated stand-alone selling prices, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its estimated stand-alone selling prices will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between performance obligations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:2pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p></ix:nonNumeric></ix:continuation></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">F-12</p></div></div>

The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i)&#160;the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii)&#160;the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company allocates the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price. The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Estimating costs for research and development programs is subjective as the Company estimates the costs anticipated to successfully complete the research performance obligations. As the research is novel, efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs at the beginning of the contract. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts the Company would expect to receive for each performance obligation.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation in order to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. The Company determines the appropriate method of measuring progress of combined performance obligations satisfied over time for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The estimated remaining costs is highly subjective, as the research is novel, therefore efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs made at the balance sheet date. If the license to the Company&#8217;s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. The Company receives payments from customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Up-front payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12&#160;months following the balance sheet date are classified as the current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12&#160;months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company&#8217;s right to consideration is unconditional. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced, are generally recognized as contract assets.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:2pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Exclusive Licenses &#8211;&#160;</i>If the license granted in the arrangement is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, which generally include research and development services, the Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, the Company considers relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the collaboration partner can benefit from the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is </p></ix:continuation></ix:continuation></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">F-13</p></div></div>

The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the arrangement.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">&#160;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:2pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Research and Development Services &#8211;&#160;</i>The promises under the Company&#8217;s collaboration and license agreements generally include research and development services to be performed by the Company on behalf of the collaboration partner. For performance obligations that include research and development services, the Company generally recognizes revenue allocated to such performance obligations based on an appropriate measure of progress. The Company utilizes judgment to determine the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue, which is generally an input measure, such as costs incurred. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period as described under&#160;<i style="font-style:italic;">Exclusive Licenses&#160;</i>above. Reimbursements from the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are generally recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:12pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Customer Options &#8211;&#160;</i>The Company&#8217;s arrangements may provide a collaborator with the right to certain optional purchases, such as the right to license a target either at the inception of the arrangement or within a pre-defined option period. Under these agreements, fees may be due to the Company (i)&#160;at the inception of the arrangement as an upfront fee or payment or (ii)&#160;upon the exercise of an option to acquire a license.&#160;If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. The Company evaluates the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates the transaction price to material rights based on the relative stand-alone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount, and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:12pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Milestone Payments &#8211;&#160;</i>At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments based on certain events, the Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of the Company or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company reevaluates the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to the Company&#8217;s efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, the Company generally allocates the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:12pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Royalties &#8211;&#160;</i>For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

Prepaid expenses are expensed as the related services are performed or goods are received. When evaluating the adequacy and accuracy of the accrued and prepaid expenses, the Company reviews open contracts and purchase orders, the level of service performed, invoices received, contracted costs, and progress of studies, clinical trials or other activities based on communication with internal and/or external personnel. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued and prepaid expense balances at the end of each reporting period, and payments for these activities are due based on the terms of individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2023_To_12_31_2023_ppNfvDwaGEqhEoehvLjPkg" name="us-gaap:ShareBasedCompensationOptionAndIncentivePlansPolicy" id="Tb_VLfLfH02nUWrn4MWB3tj2w" continuedAt="Tb_VLfLfH02nUWrn4MWB3tj2w_cont1" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Equity-Based Compensation</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company accounts for equity awards, including restricted stock units, and common stock options, granted as equity award compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation&#160;&#8212; Stock Compensation ("ASC 718"). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, which includes grants of employee equity awards, to be recognized as expense in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The fair value of each restricted stock unit is based on the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock less any purchase price, if applicable. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock and certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the award, the risk-free rate, and expected dividends. Expected volatility is calculated based on a blend of the Company&#8217;s reported volatility data for the length of time that market data was available for the Company&#8217;s stock and the historical data for a representative group of publicly traded companies, for which historical information was available. The historical volatility is generally calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption. The Company uses the simplified method, under which the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The Company utilizes this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain nature of its stock-based awards. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be <ix:nonFraction unitRef="Unit_Standard_pure_beCOBhXD106ONUqtdui24A" contextRef="Duration_1_1_2023_To_12_31_2023_us-gaap_AwardTypeAxis_us-gaap_EmployeeStockOptionMember_vMwxLv0Mrk2utvlpmvz1Cw" decimals="2" format="ixt-sec:numwordsen" name="us-gaap:ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsExpectedDividendRate" scale="-2" id="Narr_7DKM2MKT3EqN50C6Ed9CSQ">zero</ix:nonFraction> as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to pay any dividends on common stock.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Compensation expense related to equity awards to employees that are subject to graded vesting is recognized on a straight-line basis, based on the grant date fair value, over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. For awards subject to performance conditions, the Company recognizes equity award compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method over the remaining service period when management determines that achievement of the milestone is probable.

Comprehensive loss includes net loss and the change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the period.

The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income (losses) available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income (losses) for the period had been distributed. During periods of loss, there is no allocation required under the two-class method since the participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to fund the losses of the Company.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including pre-funded warrants and excluding restricted common stock. The Company calculates diluted net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, as applicable, after giving consideration to the dilutive effect of restricted stock units, warrants, pre-funded warrants, and stock options that are outstanding during the period. </p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2023_To_12_31_2023_ppNfvDwaGEqhEoehvLjPkg" name="us-gaap:IncomeTaxPolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_DGwSP1M2K0eqkM1XHTuwJw" continuedAt="Tb_DGwSP1M2K0eqkM1XHTuwJw_cont1" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Income Taxes</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax basis.

The standard requires that a financial asset or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Under previous GAAP, a company only considered past events and current conditions in measuring an incurred loss. Under ASU 2016-13, the information that a company must consider is broadened in developing an expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The use of forecasted information incorporates more timely information in the estimate of expected credit loss. The guidance is applied using a modified retrospective, or prospective approach, depending on a specific amendment. In November 2019, the FASB deferred the effective date for smaller reporting companies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. <span style="background:#ffffff;">Therefore, the new standard was effective for the Company on January 1, 2023.

The standard requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis and allows for multiple measures of a segment&#8217;s profit or loss provided that one of those measures is consistent with GAAP. The amendments in this update do not change how a public company identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments, but rather requires public entities to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reporting segment&#8217;s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually.

This requires public entities to disclose additional categories in the rate reconciliation regarding federal and state income taxes, and provide more details surrounding reconciling items if a quantitative threshold is met.
