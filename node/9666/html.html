Such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States

prospectus, that constitute non-GAAP financial measures (as defined by the rules&nbsp;and regulations under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act) comply with Regulation G under the Exchange Act and Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, as applicable. To

and Procedures.</I> If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be
brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this
Section&#8239;7, such person (the &ldquo;Indemnified Person&rdquo;) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification
may be sought (the &ldquo;Indemnifying Person&rdquo;) in writing; <U>provided</U> that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall
not relieve it from any liability that it may have under the preceding paragraphs of this Section&#8239;7 except to the extent that it
has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>,
that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise
than under the preceding paragraphs of this Section&#8239;7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified
Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent
the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section&#8239;that the Indemnifying Person may designate
in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred and documented fees and expenses in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably
incurred and documented fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified
Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Person unless (i)&#8239;the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii)&#8239;the Indemnifying
Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii)&#8239;the Indemnified
Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those
available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv)&#8239;the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate
due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection
with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
(in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they
are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter
shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed
the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person
shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any
loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person
shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by
this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i)&#8239;such
settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii)&#8239;the Indemnifying Person
shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying
Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified
Person, unless such settlement (x)&#8239;includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y)&#8239;does
not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.</FONT></P>

If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a)&#8239;or (b)&#8239;above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu
of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i)&#8239;in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, from the offering of the Shares or (ii)&#8239;if the allocation provided
by clause (i)&#8239;is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits
referred to in clause (i)&#8239;but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, in connection
with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be deemed to
be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Shares
and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in
the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company, on the
one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company
or by the Underwriters and the parties&rsquo; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission.</FONT></P>

on Liability.</I> The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph
(d)&#8239;above were determined by <U>pro rata</U> allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or
by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d)&#8239;above.
The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph
(d)&#8239;above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any documented legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (d)&#8239;and
(e), in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts
and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter
has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&#8239;11(f)&#8239;of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters&rsquo; obligations to contribute pursuant to
paragraphs (d)&#8239;and (e)&#8239;are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.</FONT></P>
