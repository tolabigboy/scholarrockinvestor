Springer, Ph.D. of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Unlike many other proteins that are produced and secreted by cells in a mature, or active, form, many growth factors are expressed by cells in a latent form. For example, TGF&#946;1 is produced by cells as a single protein which is then enzymatically processed by the cells into two distinct and physically separated domains&#160;&#8212; the mature growth factor and the remaining portion of the original protein, referred to as the prodomain&#160;&#8212; which remain associated as part of a complex. This secreted complex is latent, or inactive, and must first be activated to carry out its normal function in a highly localized tissue or disease microenvironment. In a seminal peer-reviewed publication in 2011, Dr.&#160;Springer elucidated a new understanding of the mechanism of activation of the latent growth factor complex among members of the TGF&#946; superfamily by solving a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of this latent form of TGF&#946;1 (as illustrated in the graphic below).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><img src="../../../cdn.kscope.io/001590726d218b2b5e55230a6ebe29fa-srrk-20211231x10k006.jpg" alt="Graphic" style="display:inline-block;height:250.1pt;left:0%;padding-bottom:0.4pt;position:relative;top:0pt;width:485.3pt;" /></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Structural representation of the latent form of TGF&#946;</span>1</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">wherein the prodomain wraps around the active growth factor</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">This research explained at a molecular level why the secreted form of TGF&#946;1 is inactive. The prodomain, though physically separated from the mature growth factor domain, forms&#160;a &#8220;cage&#8221; around the active form of TGF&#946;1, blocking the growth factor from signaling through its receptor. Only when the cage is &#8220;unlocked&#8221; by a precursor activation event can the growth factor be released and mediate its effects in the local microenvironment. Dr.&#160;Springer further hypothesized that this phenomenon likely holds true for most members of the TGF&#946; superfamily, though the exact nature of the activation event, such as integrin binding or enzymatic cleavage, may differ among members of the superfamily. Importantly, while many growth factors are structurally very similar, their cages are structurally diverse, and this provides the basis for our approach to improved selectivity.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">7</p></div></div>

Because our antibodies specifically bind the latent forms of the growth factors, we can prevent the activation of the growth factors. Given that many growth factors act primarily within the microenvironment where they are activated, as opposed to exerting their effects systemically, we believe that prevention of activation is a preferred mode of action for achieving improved outcomes. In contrast, traditional approaches to targeting growth factor signaling are focused on inhibiting the growth factor after it has been activated and released systemically;</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">targeting the latent precursor allows heightened selectivity among structurally related growth factors, which we believe could limit off-target effects. For example, two members of the TGF&#946; superfamily, myostatin and GDF11, are 90% identical in their growth factor domains. Therefore, many of the traditional inhibitors that target myostatin also inadvertently inhibit GDF11. Similarly, most of the known inhibitors of TGF&#946; are pan-inhibitors, meaning that they do not distinguish among the three isoforms of TGF&#946;, namely, TGF&#946;1, TGF&#946; 2 and TGF&#946;3. Despite the sequence similarities of the active forms of these growth factors, their cages are structurally diverse.

Using our structural insight, we have identified modulators of bone morphogenic protein 6 (a TGF&#946; superfamily growth factor) by selectively inhibiting its co-receptor RGMc or hemojuvelin which is required for activation. BMP6 functions as a critical control point in iron modulation via regulation of hepcidin.

It is characterized by the loss of motor neurons, atrophy of the voluntary muscles of the limbs and trunk and progressive muscle weakness. Disease severity in SMA can range from patients who die soon after birth to patients who live into adulthood with varying degrees of morbidity. The underlying pathology of SMA is caused by insufficient production of a protein known as &#8220;survival of motor neuron,&#8221; or SMN. The SMN protein, essential for the survival of motor neurons, is encoded by two genes, SMN1 and SMN2.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">SMN1 genes produce the majority of functional SMN protein; healthy individuals have one or two functional copies of SMN1, while patients with SMA have mutations in or deletions of both copies of the gene.</span></td></tr></table><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;table-layout:fixed;width:100%;border:0pt;"><tr><td style="width:18pt;"></td><td style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;width:18pt;padding:0pt;">&#9679;</td><td style="padding:0pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">SMN2 genes produce only 10% to 20% of functional SMN protein and an individual&#8217;s copy number of the SMN2 gene can range from zero to eight.

Despite progress in the development of SMN upregulator therapies, a high unmet medical need to improve motor function remains. We believe that the advancement of muscle-directed therapy will be necessary to address this important gap.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">SMN upregulator therapies are aimed at addressing the SMN deficiency to prevent further motor neuron deterioration. This category includes antisense oligonucleotide and small molecule approaches to increase SMN2 expression as well as gene therapy to deliver the SMN1 gene. The primary benefit of such an approach appears to be to address the SMN deficiency and to modify the course of disease. Early intervention at a very young age is therefore thought to be essential to prevent significant motor functional deterioration. However, for the vast majority of SMA patients living today, this early intervention window has been missed, and such individuals suffer from severe functional impairment. Thus, regardless of the precise nature or mechanism of action for any given SMN upregulator therapy, we believe that most SMA patients will continue to experience clinically significant functional deficits. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">To address this need, apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-directed therapy for SMA. We envision the potential for apitegromab to be a critical complement to any SMN upregulator therapy in patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA in order to drive absolute increases in functional performance over baseline. We also view apitegromab as having potential in the treatment of Type 1 SMA as well as presymptomatic SMA in conjunction with SMN upregulator therapy. Our vision is that apitegromab has the potential to become the backbone treatment for the broadest group of patients with SMA.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 36pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Myostatin in SMA and Challenges with Traditional Approaches</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Apitegromab is a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent myostatin that acts locally within skeletal muscle. Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor 8 (&#8220;GDF8&#8221;), is a member of the TGF&#946; superfamily and is produced by skeletal muscle cells. As with other tissues and organs in the human body, healthy muscle homeostasis is maintained by a proper balance of growth signals, or anabolic stimuli, and breakdown signals, or catabolic stimuli. In humans, the anabolic stimuli that drive muscle growth are proteins, such as the human growth hormone and the insulin-like growth factor 1. In contrast, myostatin is a catabolic agent that functions as a negative regulator of muscle mass.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Skeletal muscle fibers are generally classified as fast-twitch or slow-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers play a key role in motor activities, such as those involving quick bursts of strength. In contrast, slow-twitch fibers are important for endurance activities. Animals lacking functional myostatin genes, or its receptor, have larger muscles and increased strength compared to normal animals. While the absence of myostatin does lead to overall increases in muscle mass, a preferential effect on muscles enriched for fast-twitch muscle fibers has been observed in animals. Such animals are otherwise healthy and live a normal life-span.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Because of its role in regulating muscle mass, myostatin has been a popular target for a variety of drug development programs. There have been two general approaches to trying to inhibit the signaling of myostatin in humans. The first is to develop an antibody, or an antibody-like molecule, that binds to mature myostatin in circulation and prevents its ability to signal through its receptor, the ActRIIb receptor. The second is to develop an antibody to the ActRIIb receptor itself, or a soluble decoy of the ActRIIb receptor, with a goal of preventing myostatin signaling through its receptor. Both of these approaches, however, have significant limitations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">As a member of the TGF&#946; superfamily, mature myostatin shares considerable structural similarity with other family members. For example, the active form of myostatin and its most closely related family member, GDF11, are 90% identical in the growth factor domains, making it extremely challenging to identify antibodies that are truly specific for myostatin and do not interfere with other targets. Moreover, attempts to interrupt myostatin signaling through its receptor are complicated by the fact that the ActRIIb receptor, in addition to being the receptor for myostatin, is also the receptor for a number of related family members, including GDF11, activins and other growth factors. Attempts to block </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">13</p></div></div>

For example, in a Phase&#160;2 clinical trial in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy reported in 2017, a soluble decoy of the ActRIIb receptor resulted in bleeding side effects believed by the sponsor to be unrelated to inhibition of myostatin signaling, but instead related to the inhibition of signaling by certain other members of the TGF&#946; superfamily known to be important in the maintenance of vascular integrity. These side effects resulted in termination of the clinical program. More recently, results from a clinical trial were reported showing that treatment of patients with an antibody to the ActRIIb receptor resulted in suppression of the levels of follicle stimulating hormone, an important reproductive hormone. In this clinical trial, the sponsor believed that these effects were likely related to inhibition of signaling through the ActRIIb receptor.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:18pt;text-indent:-18pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Our Solution</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Utilizing our proprietary platform, we targeted the precursor form of myostatin and generated apitegromab, a novel, highly selective inhibitor of the activation of myostatin from its inactive precursor in skeletal muscles, where myostatin resides and signals upon activation. While mature myostatin is 90% identical in the growth factor domain to its most closely related TGF&#946; superfamily member, GDF11, the prodomain that cages mature myostatin and keeps it in its latent precursor form is only 52% identical to the GDF11 prodomain. In preclinical studies, we observed that apitegromab bound to latent myostatin with a high level of selectivity, while having no binding to, and no effect on, the activation of related TGF&#946; family members.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;">We believe that the therapeutic potential for apitegromab in improving motor function is more optimal when a given disease bears certain features. Based on our translational and preclinical efforts, we have formulated a set of guiding principles to inform indication selection within the category of neuromuscular disease. As summarized in the table below, we believe that the pathobiological and clinical characteristics of SMA are well-<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">aligned with these guiding principles. Since myostatin regulates muscle catabolism rather than anabolism, we believe that having a background of anabolic capacity is important to drive muscle growth in the setting of myostatin inhibition. Anabolic capacity is most robust in younger individuals and diminishes as one ages. SMA is a genetic disorder with onset commonly in childhood, and the initial focus of the development program will be in children and young adults.  Furthermore, in SMA, there is a significant but incomplete loss of motor neurons, ensuring at least some intact signaling between skeletal muscle and nerve. In addition, generally, there are also no apparent structural abnormalities in the skeletal muscle. The partial loss of motor neurons causes substantial atrophy of fast-twitch muscle fibers that in turn leads to many of the motor function impairments. Validated outcome measures are available for SMA clinical trials that are relevant to fast-twitch fiber activity. These outcome measures, such as the HFMSE, assess a large number of motor activities that involve short-term bursts of strength, which are driven by fast-twitch muscle fibers. These endpoints therefore measure an outcome that may be more likely to be directly affected by apitegromab.</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">14</p></div></div>

One patient discontinued from the 12-month treatment period for reasons that were determined to be unrelated to apitegromab treatment. All remaining 57 patients completed the 12-month treatment period and opted into the extension period. As of February 2022, 55 of the patients remain enrolled. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The clinical trial consisted of three distinct cohorts of patients with Type 2 or Type 3 SMA and evaluated the safety and efficacy of apitegromab over a 12-month treatment period. All patients in the clinical trial received apitegromab dosed every four weeks (Q4W) either as a monotherapy or in conjunction with an approved SMN upregulator therapy. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">In our view, this approach of having evaluated multiple distinct cohorts offers a greater number of opportunities to discern the effects of apitegromab on clinically meaningful motor function measures across multiple patient subpopulations. <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is estimated that patients with Type 2 or Type 3 SMA represent over 85% of the overall patient population.  We view each of the cohorts evaluated in the TOPAZ trial as representing a significant proportion of patients suffering from SMA.  </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The primary efficacy objectives evaluated in the TOPAZ trial, HFMSE and Revised Hammersmith Scale (&#8220;RHS&#8221;), are clinically meaningful outcome measures validated for SMA. These endpoints assess motor tasks involving short-term bursts of strength and thus involve fast-twitch fiber function. As the hypothesized effect of myostatin blockade under investigation is to drive increases in fast-twitch fiber function, we believe these endpoints are of direct relevance in assessing the clinical effect of apitegromab.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Our overall approach to the efficacy analysis is informed by SMA disease biology, the anticipated mechanism of action of apitegromab, the effects of SMN upregulators, and available clinical data on SMA. The primary effect of SMN upregulator therapy appears to be to address the SMN deficiency and to modify the disease course; thus, the key in preventing significant motor functional deterioration is intervening at a very young age. For most patients with SMA, however, this window for early intervention is no longer available. As a result, these individuals have already suffered considerable atrophy and motor function impairment. Natural history data indicate that most patients with Type 2 or 3 SMA, other than very young individuals, generally have a stable functional baseline over a 12-month period as evidenced by their HFMSE scores. A one-point improvement on the Hammersmith scale may be considered meaningful on an individual level and a spontaneous improvement of 3 or more points from one&#8217;s baseline would be a notable divergence from the otherwise expected course of disease for most patients.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">TOPAZ Twelve-Month Analysis</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">On April 6, 2021, we announced positive top-line data for the 12-month treatment period of our TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, which enrolled 58 patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA across 16 study sites in the United States and </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">16</p></div></div>

A total of 66 subjects were enrolled, including 40 subjects in the single ascending dose (&#8220;SAD&#8221;) and 26 subjects in the multiple ascending dose (&#8220;MAD&#8221;) portions of the study. Full results from the Phase 1 clinical trial were presented at the Cure SMA Annual Conference in June 2019.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Safety and immunogenicity results. </i>Apitegromab was shown to be well-tolerated with no apparent safety signals. There were no dose-limiting toxicities identified up to the highest tested dose of 30 mg/kg, treatment-related serious adverse events (&#8220;SAEs&#8221;) or hypersensitivity reactions. Immunogenicity was assessed by anti-drug antibody testing, and all subjects tested negative.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics results. </i>Apitegromab displayed a PK profile generally consistent with that commonly observed with monoclonal antibodies. Drug exposure was dose proportional, and the serum half-life was approximately 23 to 33 days across the apitegromab dose groups. The findings supported the investigation of a once every 4-week dosing regimen in the TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Mean serum concentrations of latent myostatin in the SAD were &lt; 20 ng/ml in the pre-treatment baselines for apitegromab treated subjects as well as in placebo subjects throughout the study. Following placebo treatment, there was no meaningful change in the latent myostatin biomarker concentrations. Following single doses of apitegromab at dose levels of 3 mg/kg or greater, marked increases in latent myostatin biomarker concentrations in the serum, by at least an order of magnitude, were observed following apitegromab treatment. This finding demonstrates successful target engagement and provides initial proof-of-mechanism in humans of our therapeutic approach of targeting the latent form of growth factors. The observation also corroborates our biological understanding that the vast majority of drug target (pro and latent forms of myostatin) resides within skeletal muscle rather than within the systemic circulation.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">19</p></div></div>

We also believe that the role of apitegromab as a muscle-directed therapy has broad potential beyond SMA, spanning a number of muscle disorders in which fast-twitch fibers may play an important role in motor function. In some settings, we believe that disease-stabilizing therapy may be necessary to address the underlying defect, which can then be complemented by the potential motor function-building benefit of apitegromab. In settings in which the defect may be less severe and/or the disease may have a slower rate of progression, apitegromab may have the potential to serve as a monotherapy.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">There is also increasing recognition of the important role of skeletal muscle in modulating metabolic physiology, highlighting a potential therapeutic opportunity for myostatin blockade. For example, data emerging from our preclinical experiments support the hypothesis that blockade of the myostatin pathway has the potential to reduce the mass of visceral fat, a significant driver of cardiometabolic pathophysiology. Excessive fat mass and metabolic abnormalities have been observed in many muscle atrophy states, such as SMA and spinal cord injury. More broadly, reducing visceral fat mass, or improving body compositions (e.g., enhanced muscle-to-fat ratios), may be a potential therapeutic strategy to address a wide range of disorders, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (&#8220;NASH&#8221;), diabetes, and obesity.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Based on this evidence, we believe a wide range of potential therapeutic applications may be envisioned for apitegromab.

We estimate at least 750,000 cancer patients in the US are eligible for treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapies every year, of which the majority do not respond to treatment. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Increased signaling by TGF&#946;1 is a key driver of a number of disease-relevant processes, including immune system evasion by cancer cells, bone marrow fibrosis associated with hematological disorders, and tissue and organ fibrosis. Historically, selectively targeting TGF&#946;1 signaling has been challenging due to the inability of either small molecule inhibitors or antibodies to avoid off-target inhibition of other, closely related growth factors, TGF&#946;2 and TGF&#946;3. Treatment of animals with these non-selective TGF&#946; inhibitors has been associated with a range of toxicities, most notably cardiac toxicity. Furthermore, since each of these growth factors signals through the same TGF&#946; receptor, ALK5, inhibitors of the TGF&#946; receptor kinase suffer from similar dose-limiting toxicities. In preclinical studies of our antibodies, we have observed selective inhibition of TGF&#946;1 activation <i style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</i> and immunomodulatory and antifibrotic activity in multiple disease models <i style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</i><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">. A 28-day pilot nonclinical toxicology study in rats of our leading antibody did not observe any drug-related toxicity up to the highest dose (100 mg/kg weekly) tested in the study. In the same study, we tested non-selective TGF&#946; inhibitors and observed the published toxicities, including cardiac toxicity as well as death.  We have also completed four-week GLP toxicology studies in rats and non-human primates and no SRK-181 related adverse effects were observed up to the highest evaluated dose of 200 mg/kg per week and 300 mg/kg per week, respectively.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">In many human cancers, TGF&#946; signaling is associated with lack of response to PD-(L)1 blockade, particularly in patients with tumors harboring an immune excluded phenotype (i.e., CD8+ T cells present in nearby stroma but excluded from the tumor parenchyma). We have observed multiple mouse models that recapitulate the immune-excluded phenotype and are resistant to PD-1 blockade become responsive to the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1, the murine analog of SRK-181, and an anti- PD-1 antibody. These models, including the MBT-2 bladder cancer model, the Cloudman S91 melanoma model and the EMT6 breast cancer model, were poorly responsive or unresponsive to single agent treatment with either anti-PD-1 or SRK-181-mIgG1, with little or no effect on tumor growth. However, in representative experiments, the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1 and anti-PD-1 resulted in tumor regressions of 72%, 57% and 70% in these three mouse models, respectively. Furthermore, the combination treatment led to statistically significant survival benefit in all three models (See &#8220;Preclinical Evidence in Overcoming Resistance to Checkpoint Inhibition&#8221;).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Our DRAGON Phase 1 clinical trial is intended to initially evaluate our therapeutic hypothesis that SRK-181 in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy may overcome primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and lead to anti-tumor responses. This clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors is ongoing and investigates the safety, PK and efficacy of SRK-181. The DRAGON trial consists of two parts: Part A (dose escalation of SRK-181 as a single-agent or in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy) and Part B (dose expansion evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy). Part B encompasses five cohorts, including urothelial carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and other solid tumors and commenced in 2021. Initial clinical data from Part A, primarily focused on safety and PK, was presented in November 2021 at the SITC 36th Annual Meeting. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:9.35pt;text-indent:-9.35pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 36pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Selection of a Potent and Highly Selective Inhibitor of TGF&#946;1 Activation</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">TGF&#946;1 is produced by cells as a single protein chain and is then enzymatically processed by the cells into two distinct and physically separated domains&#160;&#8212; the mature, active growth factor and the remaining portion of the original protein, referred to as the prodomain, or latency associated peptide&#160;&#8212; which remains associated with and keeps the growth factor in an inactive state. This complex is further associated with one of a number of &#8220;presenting molecules&#8221; which when secreted serve to tether the latent precursor in specific locations in the body. TGF&#946;1 is produced by a variety of cell types, including fibroblasts, which deposit latent TGF&#946;1 in connective tissue, as well as regulatory T cells and macrophages, which display latent TGF&#946;1 on their cell surfaces. </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">21</p></div></div>

This research explained at a molecular level why the secreted form of TGF</span>&#946;1 is inactive. The prodomain, though physically separated from the mature growth factor domain, forms&#160;a &#8220;cage&#8221; around the active form of TGF&#946;1, blocking the ability of the growth factor to signal through its receptor. Integrin proteins are able to unlock the &#8220;cage&#8221; by binding to the prodomain of the latent TGF&#946;1 complex and applying force to pull the complex open, allowing the mature growth factor to be released and signal in its microenvironment. While mature TGF&#946;1 shares a high degree of structural similarity with its closely related family members, TGF&#946;2 and TGF&#946;3, their respective cages are structurally diverse. By taking advantage of the differences among the prodomains, together with our understanding of the activation mechanism and ability to recapitulate the activation mechanism <i style="font-style:italic;">in vitro</i>, we were able to identify multiple highly selective inhibitors of the activation of latent TGF&#946;1. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">By specifically targeting the TGF&#946;1 isoform, we believe we have the key to unlock the power of checkpoint inhibitors and meaningfully increase response rates across multiple solid tumor types. In March 2019, we selected SRK-181 as a product candidate in our TGF&#946;1 cancer immunotherapy program based on the strength of preclinical data and human translational insights. <i style="font-style:italic;">In vitro</i> and <i style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</i> studies of SRK-181 showed that it binds to latent TGF&#946;1 with high affinity and high selectivity, which is evidenced by minimal or no binding to latent TGF&#946;2 or latent TGF&#946;3 isoforms. Integrins, such as &#945;V&#946;6 and &#945;V&#946;8, can trigger the activation of TGF&#946;1 and TGF&#946;3. In addition, biochemical evidence suggests that certain proteases (e.g., Plasmin and Kallikreins) may also induce TGF&#946; activation. Notably, these integrins and proteases have been implicated in tumor biology in a number of human cancers. SRK-181 is capable of inhibiting both integrin-dependent- and protease-induced activation of TGF&#946;1. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:14pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><img src="../../../cdn.kscope.io/001590726d218b2b5e55230a6ebe29fa-srrk-20211231x10k013.jpg" alt="Normalize of Data 1" style="display:inline-block;height:198pt;width:414pt;" /></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">SRK-181 selectively binds to proTGF&#946;1complexes with minimal or no binding to proTGF&#946;2 or proTGF&#946;3 complexes.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-left:9.35pt;text-indent:-9.35pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 36pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">TGF</b><b style="font-weight:bold;">&#946;</b><b style="font-weight:bold;">1 in Cancer Therapy </b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">We believe that specific inhibition of TGF&#946;<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1 may have a significant impact on the treatment of patients in certain oncology settings.  </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Immune checkpoints are cellular mechanisms that act as a brake on the immune system, and expression of these proteins in the tumor microenvironment creates an immunosuppressive environment that allows tumor cells to evade being killed by the immune system.

Similarly, it has also been reported that retrospective pathway analysis of tumor samples from an atezolizumab bladder cancer trial identified the TGF&#946; pathway as a major determinant of primary resistance to atezolizumab. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Our analysis of publicly available human tumor data has identified TGF&#946;1 as the predominant TGF&#946; isoform expressed in many solid tumors. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><img src="../../../cdn.kscope.io/001590726d218b2b5e55230a6ebe29fa-srrk-20211231x10k014.jpg" alt="Graphic" style="display:inline-block;height:176.15pt;left:0.31%;padding-bottom:0.85pt;position:relative;top:1.5pt;width:265.8pt;" /></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">National Cancer Institute - Cancer Genome Atlas Program RNAseq analysis of &gt;10,000 samples spanning 33 tumor types show high expression of the TGF&#946;1 isoform across many in many tumor types</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Preclinical Evidence in Overcoming Resistance to Checkpoint Inhibition</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Using multiple mouse models that recapitulate the immune-excluded phenotype, we have observed that co-administration of SRK-181-mIgG1, the murine version of SRK-181, with an anti-PD-1 antibody renders these tumor models sensitive to the combination treatment. These models, including the MBT-2 bladder cancer model, the Cloudman S91 melanoma model and the EMT6 breast cancer model, are poorly responsive or unresponsive to single agent treatment with either anti-PD-1 or SRK-181-mIgG1, with little or no effect on tumor growth. However, the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1 and anti-PD-1 resulted in tumor regressions.

Under the collaboration, Gilead had exclusive options to license worldwide rights to antibodies from certain TGF&#946; programs being developed by us. We received $80.0 million in proceeds upon signing the agreement and an additional $25.0 million for a preclinical milestone achieved in December 2019 for the successful demonstration of efficacy in preclinical <i style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</i> proof-of-concept studies. The collaboration period concluded on December 19, 2021 and on January 6, 2022, Gilead agreed that its option exercise period for all programs terminated which returned rights to us to a suite of antibodies with novel pharmacological profiles that were discovered over the course of the collaboration with Gilead. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Of particular note, we have discovered antibodies that selectively inhibit the activation of latent TGF&#946;1 in the context of fibrotic extracellular matrix and that avoid perturbing TGF&#946;1 presented by cells of immune system. Such antibodies demonstrated significant antifibrotic activity in a variety of preclinical rodent models and safety at all doses tested in a non-GLP mouse safety study.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">TGF&#946;1 in Fibrosis</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">Fibrosis is a pathological feature of disease which can occur in virtually all organs, characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the affected tissue and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality. The TGF&#946; signaling pathway as a central regulator of fibrosis has been well-established. TGF&#946; is upregulated in many animal models of fibrosis, and overexpression of TGF&#946; <i style="font-style:italic;">in vivo</i><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> induces fibrotic changes. Furthermore, TGF&#946; inhibition in animal models has been shown to reduce fibrosis in models of hepatic, renal and cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, fresolisumab, an inhibitor of all three TGF&#946; isoforms, was evaluated in an open-label clinical trial involving patients with systemic sclerosis, a fibrotic connective tissue disease.  Improvement in clinical skin disease as measured by the modified Rodnan skin score, a commonly used measure of skin thickness, was observed, although bleeding episodes and other safety findings similar to those associated with non-selective TGF&#946; inhibition were also reported in this clinical trial. These data suggest that novel approaches to targeting TGF&#946; signaling may have broad applicability to the treatment of fibrotic disease, where more selective approaches may offer an improved safety profile. We have identified a suite of antibodies with anti-fibrotic activity acting through novel selectivity profiles that were discovered over the course of the collaboration including those which may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of organ fibrosis by inhibiting TGF&#946;1 function in connective tissue while having no impact on the activation or signaling of TGF&#946;1 in the immune system.  We plan to continue the advancement of these assets as part of our growing preclinical pipeline</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Context-dependent TGF&#946;1 Inhibitors</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">As mentioned, when latent TGF&#946;1 is secreted from cells, it is further associated with a third protein, referred to as a presenting molecule. The presenting molecules are covalently bound to the prodomain and serve to tether the latent TGF&#946;1 complex in a particular microenvironment. Unlike TGF&#946;1, a given presenting molecule&#39;s expression pattern is restricted to particular cellular and tissue environments. For example, the presenting molecule GARP is found primarily on regulatory T cells, the presenting molecules LTBP1 and LTBP3 are localized to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix, and the presenting molecule LRRC33 is found primarily on certain myeloid lineage cells such as macrophages.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:14pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">27</p></div></div>

Patent prosecution of these pending patent families is ongoing but relatively early. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-bottom:14pt;background:#ffffff;margin:0pt;">Two families are directed to composition of matter claims that cover our proprietary antibodies. PCT/US2015/059468 (published as WO 2016/073853) broadly covers a class of monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind inactive precursors thereby preventing activation of myostatin. This patent family is projected to expire in November 2035. U.S. Patents 10,307,480 and 11,135,291 have issued in June 2019 and October 2021, respectively, with issued claims directed to Scholar Rock proprietary antibodies that specifically bine pro/latent myostatin, including 29H4, the parental clone of apitegromab<span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">, and variants, as well as methods of making antibodies with pH sensitive binding to pro/latent myostatin.  A second family, PCT/US2016/052014 (published as WO 2017/049011), discloses the specific amino acid sequence of </span>apitegromab and is projected to expire in September 2036. U.S. Patent 10,751,413 issued in August 2020, with claims directed to antibodies and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the heavy and light chain sequences of apitegromab. The European counterpart also granted as EP 3350220 B1 in May 2021.

Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties, may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. As mentioned above, two granted patents, EP2981822 and EP3368069, are currently the subject of ongoing opposition proceedings before the EPO. While there are currently no contested proceedings or third-party claims relating to any of the other patents described above, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not have such proceedings or third-party claims at a later date.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;padding-bottom:14pt;background:#ffffff;margin:0pt;">The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20&#160;years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14&#160;years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic or provide an additional period of protection for the approved pharmaceutical product following expiry of the patent. In the future, if our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the U.S. and the national patent offices in Europe, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;background:#ffffff;margin:0pt;">In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates and research programs, we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. For example, certain elements of our proprietary platform may be based on unpatented trade secrets that are not publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party&#39;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations, and our advice for best practices, in protecting our trade secrets.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:14pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Manufacturing</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We do not own or operate facilities for clinical drug manufacturing, storage, distribution or quality testing. Currently, all of our clinical manufacturing is outsourced to third-party manufacturers. As our development programs expand and we build new process efficiencies, we expect to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for registration trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale and distribution of commercial products.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">35</p></div></div>

Certain antibody discovery and optimization vendors require us to enter into a license with them for the right to use antibodies discovered by them in humans or for commercial purposes. Such license could include substantial milestone payments and royalties to the extent we choose to use an antibody discovered by such vendor. On March 12, 2019, we exercised an option to receive such a license from Adimab pursuant to our Adimab Agreement.  Please see the description above in &#8220;License Agreements &#8211; Adimab Agreement&#8221; for more details on the terms of this agreement.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Competition</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition, and strong defense of intellectual property.

We believe that it will take several treatment approaches to holistically treat SMA. The SMA drug development pipeline reflects that, wherein existing companies are looking to enhance their current offering or SMA portfolio, newer companies to the field, such as Scholar Rock, are researching novel approaches to target systems and processes adversely impacted by SMA to help slow the disease progression.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In October 2021, Roche announced the initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial to investigate RO7204239, an anti-myostatin antibody targeting the muscles in SMA patients.  This announcement follows the approval of Roche&#8217;s SMN directed treatment.

Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties.

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30&#160;days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.

Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">FDA Review Process</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses.

The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product&#8217;s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.

The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60&#160;days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file (&#8220;RTF&#8221;) by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10&#160;months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an Approval Letter or a Complete Response Letter. An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase&#160;3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Orphan Drug Designation</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">40</p></div></div>

Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Rare Pediatric Disease Designation</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The FDA grants Rare Pediatric Disease designation for serious and life-threatening diseases that primarily affect children ages 18 years or younger and fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Eligibility for a priority review voucher may be issued upon approval of a biologics license application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) or New Drug Application for therapies developed to treat such rare pediatric diseases. Priority review vouchers may be redeemed to obtain priority review for any subsequent marketing application or be sold or transferred.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Expedited Development and Review Programs</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for Fast Track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (&#8220;IMM&#8221;), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA currently requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. If the FDA determines that the conditions of approval are not being met, the FDA can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as Fast Track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">41</p></div></div>

The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (&#8220;PSP&#8221;) within 60&#160;days of an end-of-Phase&#160;2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase&#160;3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Post-marketing Requirements</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;">Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue.  Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws, as well as applicable tracking and tracing requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">42</p></div></div>

Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Further, in some cases where we process sensitive and personal information of individuals from numerous states, we may find it necessary to comply with the most stringent state laws applicable to any of the information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the &#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households, went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020.  While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted.

Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14&#160;years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (&#8220;BPCI Act&#8221;). This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">A reference biological product is granted 12&#160;years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. &#8220;First licensure&#8221; typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the U.S. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;">Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods.

The main characteristics of the new Clinical Trials Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.

The PIP outlines the pharmaceutical company&#8217;s strategy for investigation of the new medicinal product in the pediatric population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the EC, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of any supplementary protection certificate (&#8220;SPC&#8221;), provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">European Union Expedited Review and Development</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">PRIME, or PRIority MEdicine, is a scheme provided by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation where the MAA will be made through the centralized procedure. To qualify for PRIME, product candidates require early clinical evidence that the therapy has the potential to offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefits patients without treatment options. Products from small-and medium-sized enterprises (&#8220;SMEs&#8221;) may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Among the benefits of PRIME are the appointment of a rapporteur to provide continuous support and help build knowledge ahead of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process. The receipt of PRIME designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Where, during the course of development, a product no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">European Union Drug Marketing</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the U.S., the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is typically governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician&#8217;s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States.

The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU Member States and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU Member State, this national MA can be recognized in another Member State through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference Member State (&#8220;RMS&#8221;). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (&#8220;SmPC&#8221;), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e.,&#160;in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">A paediatric-use marketing authorization (&#8220;PUMA&#8221;) is available for medicines which are already authorized, no longer covered by an SPC or patent that qualifies as an SPC and which are to be exclusively development for use in children. A PUMA is a dedicated MA covering the indication and formulation of a medicinal product developed exclusively for use in the paediatric population, where such development has been in accordance with an approved PIP. There are various incentives to apply for a PUMA, including access to the centralized procedure even where the product would otherwise fall outside the mandatory scope of this procedure. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">European Union Data and Market Exclusivity</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products from referencing the innovator&#8217;s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11&#160;years if, during the first eight years of those 10&#160;years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">51</p></div></div>

A &#8220;similar medicinal product&#8221; is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinial product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval.

The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal data (such as health and other sensitive data,) relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the EEA, including to the U.S., providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information, responding to individuals&#8217; requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information, reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments, and record-keeping. The GDPR increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of our total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Given the limited enforcement of the GDPR to date, we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on our trials and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">National laws of member states of the EU are in the process of being adapted to the requirements under the GDPR, thereby implementing national laws which may partially deviate from the GDPR and impose different obligations from country to country, so that we do not expect to operate in a uniform legal landscape in the EEA. Also, as it relates to processing and transfer of genetic data, the GDPR specifically allows national laws to impose additional and more specific requirements or restrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional uncertainty. In addition, further to the UK&#8217;s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">52</p></div></div>

However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK&#8217;s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK&#8217;s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU&#8217;s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to &#163;17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU&#8217;s GDPR, the EC has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In the event we continue to conduct clinical trials in the EEA, we must also ensure that we maintain adequate safeguards to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA, in particular to the U.S., in compliance with European data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the EC issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that were adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the EC&#8217;s new standard contractual clauses but has published a draft version of a UK-specific transfer mechanism, which, once finalized, will enable transfers from the UK. Following a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union, in Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems (&#8216;Schrems II&#8217;), Case C-311/18 (&#8220;Schrems II&#8221;), companies relying on standard contractual clauses to govern transfers of personal data to third countries (in particular the United States) will need to assess whether the data importer can ensure sufficient guarantees for safeguarding the personal data under GDPR. This assessment includes assessing whether third party vendors can also ensure these guarantees. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost. We expect that we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by a European data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by European data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products and solutions due to the potential risk exposure as a result of the current (and, in particular, future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical partners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Regulation in the United Kingdom</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently largely aligns with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in the future now that Great Britain&#8217;s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Clinical Trials </b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;line-height:1.13;margin:6pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">The UK has implemented the now repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended).

There is now no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the EU) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an application for a UK or Great Britain MA. The criteria for orphan designation remain the same as in the EU, except that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in Great Britain, as opposed to the EU).  </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Rest of the World Regulation</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">For other countries outside of the UK, the EU and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Additional Laws and Regulations Governing International Operations</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">If we further expand our operations outside of the U.S., we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA&#8217;s accounting provisions.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">54</p></div></div>

In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor&#8217;s determination that use of a product is (i) a covered benefit under its health plan; (ii) safe, effective and medically necessary; (iii) appropriate for the specific patient; (iv) cost-effective; and (v) neither experimental nor investigational.  A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the U.S. no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs or biological products exists, and one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. The level of coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor.  One payor&#8217;s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. The coverage determination process may be a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A third-party payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and payors, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company&#8217;s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products.  </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">Additional federal programs apply to pharmaceutical companies that affect coverage and reimbursement for drug products. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers&#8217; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (&#8220;AMP&#8221;) to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for &#8220;line extensions&#8221; (i.e.,&#160;new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new method by which rebates owed by are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">55</p></div></div>

Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the &#8220;MMA&#8221;) established the Medicare Part&#160;D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part&#160;D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part&#160;A and B, Part&#160;D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part&#160;D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part&#160;D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part&#160;D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part&#160;D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part&#160;D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part&#160;D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part&#160;B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#8217;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low priced and high priced member states, can further reduce prices. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">56</p></div></div>

We are guided by our core values to create a collaborative, flexible, agile, empowering, and silo-free culture so that we can move with speed and urgency to deliver high-impact medicines to patients with devastating diseases.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Employees. </span><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of March 1, 2022, we had 145 full-time employees, of which 110 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 35 are engaged in general and administrative activities. All of our employees are based in the U.S. and a majority are based in Massachusetts. During 2021, we enhanced our capabilities by adding 23 new full-time employees. The new employees were hired to support a variety of functions and key initiatives, including extending our research, clinical and pre-clinical pipeline development, with hires in clinical development and operations, research, and general and administrative functions. We anticipate continuing to add depth and new capabilities in key areas of our business. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.  </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Career Development and Growth. </span>We emphasize employee development and training. To empower employees to unleash their potential individually and as a team, we invest in our employees by providing development opportunities, and the necessary resources to support their success, including coaching, management and leadership training, presentation workshops and paid conference attendance. The diversity of our employees and their skillsets also offers a unique opportunity for us to learn from each other&#8217;s experiences.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Compensation and Benefits</span><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">. Our competitive compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. We provide employee salaries that are competitive within our industry based on position, skill level, experience and knowledge.  Additionally, we offer equity to each of our employees to align the interests of our employees with the company&#8217;s mission.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of the benefits we offer are: medical insurance including prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, accident insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, wellness programs, access to mental health support and benefits, identity theft insurance and pet insurance.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Employee Engagement</span>. We routinely conduct confidential employee engagement surveys to obtain feedback on a variety of topics, including culture, values, diversity and inclusion, career development, employee satisfaction and tenure, and execution of our company strategy. These survey results are reviewed by our executive team so that we can continue to continue to increase employee satisfaction and improve the well-being of our employees.<span style="font-size:12pt;"> </span>We value and encourage fostering mechanisms and opportunities for two-way dialogue. We actively strive to operationalize feedback provided by employees in ways that align with our business and culture. We are also committed to communication and transparency, using multiple forums and channels to allow for the sharing of appropriate, timely information to all employees.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Health &amp; Safety</span>. Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees and communities is of the utmost importance to us, particularly in light of COVID-19. What we have seen as a result of the pandemic is that flexibility is top of mind and a key consideration. At the start of the pandemic, we immediately formed a task force to keep up to date on federal, state and local mandates as well as the evolving science and communicate with our employees on a regular basis. We&#8217;ve offered daily onsite testing, masks at no cost to our employees and visitors and when necessary, conduct internal contract tracing. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">57</p></div></div>

We&#8217;ve helped employees set up home offices, provided them access to tools to perform their jobs remotely, provided ergonomic assessments of their working environments, and helped them address IT connectivity. We&#8217;ve also found ways to continue to foster collaboration and community through events like virtual trivia nights, scavenger hunts, coffee chats, charitable giving and lunch-n-learns, that we would normally do in person.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Diversity &amp; Inclusion (&#8220;D&amp;I&#8221;): </span>We believe that fostering diversity and inclusion is a business imperative which supports and encourages individuals to show up as their whole selves. Investing in meaningful D&amp;I work enhances culture and employee experience. We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive and safe work environment. As we grow and mature, we look forward to establishing programs that infuse D&amp;I within the business, identify barriers that impact recruitment, development and retention of underrepresented employees, identify educational content, communicate the value and impact of D&amp;I on goals and objectives, all while continuing to focus on hiring diverse talent at all levels of the company. Our ability to innovate and meet people&#8217;s needs is strongest when all voices are heard and valued.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">COVID-19 Pandemic </b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, as a pandemic (the &#8220;COVID-19 pandemic&#8221;), which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, including the development and deployment of any vaccine program. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, including our clinical trials, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions that have impacted our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access and monitor certain clinical trial sites, restrictions on clinical trial participants&#8217; ability to access our clinical trial sites and delays in enrollment. Some clinical trial participants have missed or experienced delays in receiving doses of study drug and completing their clinical trial assessments. For example, four patients (one in Cohort 2 and three in Cohort 3) of the TOPAZ clinical trial each missed three doses of apitegromab over the course of the 12-month treatment period due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions.  This has affected our clinical trials and could result in further impacts, including delays in or adverse impacts to data readouts from our clinical trials, delays in our ability to identify and enroll patients in current or future clinical trials and decisions by enrolled patients to discontinue from our clinical trials due to COVID-19 related concerns. While our laboratory operations have resumed to near-normal capacity, we may continue to experience challenges in procuring materials and supplies, as well as research services from our vendors in a consistently timely manner due to COVID-19 related supply chain issues. Some of our third-party manufacturers have diverted resources or manufacturing capacity to accommodate the development or manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. Although this has not had an impact on our ability to produce sufficient quantities of apitegromab or SRK-181 for our clinical trials, we continue to work closely with our third-party manufacturers to mitigate potential impacts to our clinical supply chain. In addition, delays in the development of COVID-19 vaccines or the deployment of vaccines which are approved or otherwise authorized for emergency use, a recurrence or &#8220;subsequent waves&#8221; of COVID-19 cases, or the discovery of vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants could cause other widespread or more severe impacts. We continue to monitor developments as we adjust to the disruptions and evaluate the uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Facilities</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Our corporate headquarters and operations are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In March 2015, we entered into a lease of laboratory and office space at 620 Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

A suspension or termination may be imposed due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA, EMA, competent authorities and/or ethics committees of the EU Member States or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product or treatment, failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful trial endpoints, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Further, the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials. For example, we anticipate some of our future trials to, in part, utilize an open-label trial design, and our ongoing DRAGON Phase 1 clinical trial for SRK-181 in cancer immunotherapy and our ongoing extension phase of the TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial for apitegromab in Type 2 and Type 3 SMA, in part, utilize an open-label trial design. An open-label trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the test article or either an existing approved drug or placebo. Open-label trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label studies are aware that they are receiving treatment. Open-label trials may be subject to a patient bias, for example, if patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. Open-label trials also may be subject to an investigator bias where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The potential sources of bias in clinical trials as a result of open-label design may not be adequately mitigated and may cause any of our trials that utilize such design to fail and additional trials may be necessary to support future marketing applications.  In addition, other types of trials (including randomized, double-blind, parallel arm studies), particularly if smaller in size or if limited to one study, are also subject to potential sources of bias and limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect or falsely identify a positive efficacy signal</span>, <span style="font-weight:normal;">or conversely, fail to detect an efficacy signal when in fact there may actually be a positive therapeutic effect.</span> <span style="font-weight:normal;"> Further, the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials.</span> <span style="font-weight:normal;">The unpredictability caused by turnover at the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities could increase the risk of such change in the requirements for approval, which could impact our ability to receive approval, or could otherwise delay our clinical development programs and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in clinical testing or marketing approvals.

Despite recent progress in the administration of vaccines, both the outbreak of recent variants, including Delta and Omicron, and the related containment and mitigation measures that have been put into place across the globe, have had an adverse impact on the global economy and our business, the severity and duration of which are uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services may be slow to return to pre-pandemic levels, if they return to pre-pandemic levels. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees are continuing to work remotely outside of our offices. Additionally, while our laboratory operations resumed to near-normal capacity, we may continue to experience challenges in procuring materials and supplies in a consistently timely manner due to COVID-19-related supply chain issues. We rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture apitegromab and SRK-181. The demand for COVID-19 vaccines and potential for manufacturing facilities and materials to be commandeered under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or equivalent foreign legislation, may make it more difficult to obtain materials or manufacturing slots needed for apitegromab or SRK-181. If any of our third-party manufacturers is adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or if they divert resources or manufacturing capacity to accommodate the development or manufacture of COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to supply apitegromab or SRK-181 for our clinical trials. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions that impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our clinical trials include sites located in regions that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and many sites have instituted policies regarding operations.

As an example of impacts upon our development programs, the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a negative or poor result in the Phase 3 trial of apitegromab in SMA and rejection for product approval by regulatory authorities, a delay in a potential regulatory filing for product approval, the requirement for additional clinical trial(s) beyond the currently planned program (e.g., if the amount of data from our Phase 3 trial is deemed by regulatory authorities as insufficient or confounded due to COVID-19 impacts), or other adverse outcomes.  </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions to contain the COVID-19 coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Our clinical development strategy depends on the continued use and availability of certain third-party approved drug therapies. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Apitegromab and SRK-181 are our two clinical-stage product candidates.

Preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials are primarily designed to study PK and PD, understand the side effects of product candidates, and evaluate various doses and dosing schedules.  Our current or future product candidates may demonstrate different chemical, biological and pharmacological properties in patients than they do in laboratory studies or may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen or harmful ways. Product candidates in later-stages of clinical trials may fail to show desired pharmacological properties or produce positive safety and efficacy results despite having progressed through preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials.  We completed a Phase 1 trial for apitegromab in healthy adult volunteers and the TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA.  In April 2021, we announced positive twelve-month top-line results from the TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial and from June to October 2021, we announced supportive data from additional exploratory analyses at various medical congresses.  In January 2022, we initiated our SAPPHIRE Phase 3 clinical trial of apitegromab for the treatment of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA.  In November 2021, we presented interim clinical data from Part A of our DRAGON Phase 1 trial in cancer immunotherapy, at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer&#8217;s Annual Meeting. We cannot assure you that the DRAGON Phase 1 trial or any other future clinical trials of SRK-181 or apitegromab will show positive results.  There can be no assurance that any of our current clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our product candidates.  There can also be no assurance that any of our future clinical trials will show similar results to our earlier clinical trials or support further development or registration of any of our product candidates.</span> <span style="font-weight:normal;"> There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologics proceeding through clinical trials.

As a result, we may encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials for apitegromab due, in part, to the small size of this patient population. In addition, our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site.

Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with Good Clinical Practice (&#8220;GCP&#8221;) requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to suspend or terminate these trials or perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the GCP requirements.  We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in civil monetary penalties, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. The FDA and National Institutes of Health recently signaled the government&#8217;s willingness to begin enforcing these registration and reporting requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.

Additionally, the orphan designation requires that there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Any Orphan Drug designation that we are granted for our product candidates in the U.S. or in the EU would not assure Orphan Drug designation of those product candidates in any other jurisdiction.

In addition, if a product candidate receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity for that indication. Orphan drug exclusivity means the FDA may not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to scientific assistance regarding necessary tests and trials, financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following grant of marketing authorization for the medicinal product if the criteria for orphan designation continue to be met before the grant of the marketing authorization. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We have received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for apitegromab for the treatment of SMA, and following the EMA&#8217;s COMP&#8217;s positive opinion, the EC designated apitegromab as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of SMA.

Further, even if we receive orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition during the exclusivity period because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition, and the same product can be approved for different uses. Also, in the U.S., even after an orphan drug is approved and receives orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA may subsequently approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the latter drug is not the same drug, including because it has been shown to be clinically superior to the drug with exclusivity because it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.

Even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, the EC, the competent authorities of EU Member States or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions may not approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in other countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the U.S., including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions.

There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently aligns in the most part with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain&#8217;s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. For example, the new Clinical Trials Regulation which became effective in the EU on January 31, 2022 and provides for a streamlined clinical trial application and assessment procedure covering multiple EU Member States has not been implemented into UK law, and a separate application will need to be submitted for clinical trial authorization in the UK. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend in part on how the terms of the TCA continue to take effect in practice and the terms of any further agreements the UK makes with the EU. Such a withdrawal from the EU is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the restrictions on the UK&#8217;s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services and labor, or single market, and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our future operations and clinical activities in the UK in the long term.  </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Risk Related to Manufacturing and Supply</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Because we rely on third-party manufacturing and supply partners, our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development materials, and, if approved, commercial materials, may become limited or interrupted or may not be of satisfactory quantity or quality.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture some of our preclinical product candidate supplies and rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture all of our clinical trial product supplies and, if approved, will rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture all of our commercial product supplies, including all of our drug substance, vialing, labeling, and packaging.

Some states mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time and resource consuming and can divert a company&#8217;s attention from the business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical manufacturer to incur significant legal expenses and divert management&#8217;s attention from the operation of the business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect business in an adverse way.</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">81</p></div></div>

In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our CROs and collaborators. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by HITECH. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Compliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals&#8217; privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We have conducted our TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial of apitegromab in the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;), plan to conduct our SAPPHIRE Phase 3 clinical trial of apitegromab in the EEA and the UK, and may conduct future clinical trials in the EEA or the UK and therefore may be subject to additional privacy laws. The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal information relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the EEA, including to the U.S., providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information, responding to individuals&#8217; requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information, where required reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, where required, appointing data protection officers, where required conducting data protection impact assessments, and record-keeping. The GDPR increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of our total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers.</span> <span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition, further to the UK&#8217;s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK&#8217;s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK&#8217;s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU&#8217;s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to &#163;17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU&#8217;s GDPR, the EC has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing. </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">82</p></div></div>

Given the new law, we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the law. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">EU Member States have adopted implementing national laws to implement the EU GDPR which may partially deviate from the EU GDPR and the competent authorities in the EU Member States may interpret GDPR obligations slightly differently from country to country, so that we do not expect to operate in a uniform legal landscape in the EU. Also, as it relates to processing and transfer of genetic data, the GDPR specifically allows national laws to impose additional and more specific requirements or restrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional uncertainty. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We expect that we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by a European or UK data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by European or UK data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products and solutions due to the potential risk exposure as a result of the current (and, in particular, future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical partners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition, many states in which we operate have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Further, in some cases where we process sensitive and personal information of individuals from numerous states, we may find it necessary to comply with the most stringent state laws applicable to any of the information. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Policy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. While there are currently exceptions for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. We continue to monitor the impact that the state consumer privacy and protection law, like the CCPA may have on our business activities.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">83</p></div></div>

In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting.

Our research and development activities involve the use of biological and hazardous materials and produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

Since April 2021, the FDA has conducted limited inspections and employed&#160;remote interactive evaluations, using risk management methods, to meet user fee commitments and goal dates.&#160;Ongoing travel restrictions and other uncertainties continue to impact oversight operations both domestically and abroad and it is unclear when standard operational levels will resume. The FDA is continuing to complete mission-critical work, prioritize other higher-tiered inspectional needs (e.g., for-cause inspections), and carry out surveillance inspections using risk-based approaches.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, as of May 26, 2021, the FDA noted it is continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards.  However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and approval timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions the FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period.  Should the FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, and the FDA does not determine a remote interactive evaluation to be adequate, the agency has stated that it generally intends to issue, depending on the circumstances, a complete response letter or may defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA&#39;s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. Additionally, regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities. If a prolonged government shutdown or other disruption occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future shutdowns or other disruptions could also affect other government agencies such as the SEC, which may also impact our business by delaying review of our public filings, to the extent such review is necessary, and our ability to access the public markets.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Our current laboratory operations are concentrated in one location, and we or the third parties upon whom we depend, including our clinical trial sites and the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, may experience business interruptions and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster, including earthquakes, outbreak of disease or other natural disasters.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Our office and laboratory facilities are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or manmade accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, the facilities at any clinical trial site, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of apitegromab, SRK-181 and future product candidates or interruption of our business operations. If a natural disaster, outbreak of disease, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our research facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has already resulted in extended shutdowns of certain businesses and has had ripple effects to businesses around the world. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services may be slow to return to pre-pandemic levels. In response to the spread of COVID-19 many of our employees are continuing to work remotely outside of our offices. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to identify and enroll patients in current and future clinical trials may become more difficult and costly and data readouts from our clinical trials may be delayed or adversely impacted. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business or operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 coronavirus and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.  </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">86</p></div></div>

For example, we are conducting SAPPHIRE, our Phase 3 clinical trial of apitegromab in the US and EU, and regional instability caused by the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect the conduct of our clinical trial.  Such conflicts could lead to sanctions, embargoes, supply shortages, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, cyberattacks, other retaliatory actions, and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates, and financial markets, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results, as well as those of third parties with whom we conduct business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event.

Coverage and reimbursement for products may vary widely across national payors from country to country.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive evidence generation studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such a product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to current standards of care, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to cover its costs or make a profit. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of product candidates. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our product candidates. There is significant uncertainty related to insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures are expected to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the U.S. and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, cost containment initiatives and additional legislative changes. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or will be losing employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">EU drug marketing and reimbursement regulations may materially affect our ability to market and receive coverage for our products in the European member states.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions.

In some foreign countries, particularly those in the EU, the pricing of medicinal products is subject to governmental control and other market regulations which could put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receiving marketing approval of a product candidate.

Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician&#8217;s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition, in most foreign countries, including several EU Member States, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further reduce prices. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues from sales by us or our strategic partners and the potential profitability of any of our product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">We may seek to enter into collaborations in the future with third parties, including for apitegromab, SRK-181 or potential product candidates.

Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator&#8217;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator&#8217;s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations or do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates, bring them to market and generate revenue from sales of drugs or continue to develop our technology, and our business may be materially and adversely affected. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish new strategic collaborations, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such strategic collaborations if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product are disappointing. Any delay in entering into new strategic collaboration agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property.

Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. If we are unable to secure and maintain patent protection for any product or technology we develop, or if the scope of the patent protection secured is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to commercialize any product candidates we may develop may be adversely affected. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The patenting process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all relevant markets. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and are reliant on our licensors or licensees. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the U.S. and/or in other foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property and/or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">We cannot be certain that we are the first to invent the inventions covered by pending patent applications and, if we are not, we may be subject to priority disputes.

There may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim. There also may be prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim. No assurance can be given that if challenged, our patents would be declared by a court to be valid or enforceable or that even if found valid and enforceable, a competitor&#8217;s technology or product would be found by a court to infringe our patents. We may analyze patents or patent applications of our competitors that we believe are relevant to our activities, and consider that we are free to operate in relation to our product candidates, but our competitors may achieve issued claims, including in patents we consider to be unrelated, which block our efforts or may potentially result in our product candidates or our activities infringing such claims. The possibility exists that others will develop products which have the same effect as our products on an independent basis which do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property rights, or will design around the claims of patents that we have had issued that cover our products. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition, periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. Patent Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent application process and following the issuance of a patent. While an inadvertent lapse can, in many cases, be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents.

Under the enacted Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the &#8220;America Invents Act&#8221;), enacted in 2013, the U.S. moved from a &#8220;first to invent&#8221; to a &#8220;first to file&#8221; system. Under a &#8220;first to file&#8221; system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The America Invents Act includes a number of other significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and establish a new post-grant review system. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO only recently developed new regulations and procedures in connection with the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law, including the &#8220;first to file&#8221; provisions, only became effective in March 2013. In addition, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have also narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised eligibility and validity standards.  </span><span style="font-weight:normal;">Additionally, some of our owned or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in proceedings before the USPTO, or during litigation, under the revised criteria which could also make it more difficult to obtain patents.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the case Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi, the Federal Circuit held that a well characterized antigen is insufficient to satisfy the written description requirement of certain claims directed to a genus of antibodies that are solely defined by function. While the validity of a subset of patents at issue was subsequently upheld by a district court jury, uncertainty remains as to the legal question pertaining to the written description requirement under 35 USC &#167;112 as it relates to functional antibodies. In the case of Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable. We cannot predict how these decisions or any future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may impact the value of our patents. Similarly, any adverse changes in the patent laws of other jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our product discovery and development efforts.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.

Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of drugs, products or their methods of use or manufacture.

Generally, conducting clinical trials and other development activities in the U.S. is protected under the Safe Harbor exemption as set forth in 35 U.S.C. &#167; 271. If and when apitegromab, SRK-181 or another one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, that certain third-party may then seek to enforce its patent by filing a patent infringement lawsuit against us. While we are not aware of any claims of such a patent that could otherwise materially adversely affect commercialization of our product candidates, we may be incorrect in this belief, or we may not be able to prove it in a litigation. In this regard, patents issued in the U.S. by law enjoy a presumption of validity that can be rebutted only with evidence that is &#8220;clear and convincing,&#8221; a heightened standard of proof. There may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of our product candidates, constructs or molecules used in or formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">96</p></div></div>

In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our ability to commercialize our product candidates may be impaired or delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business. Even if we obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Parties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, and/or pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We may also choose to challenge the patentability of claims in a third-party&#8217;s U.S. patent by requesting that the USPTO review the patent claims in an ex-parte re-exam, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings. These proceedings are expensive and may consume our time or other resources. We may choose to challenge the grant of a third-party&#8217;s patent in opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office (&#8220;EPO&#8221;) or other foreign patent office. The costs of these opposition proceedings could be substantial, and may consume our time or other resources.

To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims against a third party(ies), which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one or more of our patents is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of our patents or the patents of our licensors is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the third-party on the ground that such third-party&#8217;s activities do not infringe our owned or in-licensed patents. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.

If we, or our licensors, later sue such third-party for patent infringement, the third-party may have certain legal defenses available to it, which otherwise would not be available except for the delay between when the infringement was first detected and when the suit was brought. Such legal defenses may make it impossible for us or our licensors to enforce our owned or in-licensed patents, as the case may be, against such third-party.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Issued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or the USPTO.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third-party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the U.S. or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include inter parties review, ex parte re-examination, post-grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings).  For example, EP3368069 and EP2981822 are currently subject to opposition proceedings.  Such proceedings are expensive and could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our rights, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In addition, because some patent applications in the U.S. may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in PCT member jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the earliest filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our owned and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications, or that we or, if applicable, a licensor were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our products, compositions, methods of use, or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our owned and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned by or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. If we or one of our licensors is a party to an interference proceeding involving a U.S. patent application on inventions owned by or in-licensed to us, we may incur substantial costs, divert management&#8217;s time and expend other resources, even if we are successful.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">For applications filed under pre-AIA, interference proceedings declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.

Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products and/or methods of medical treatment, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products against third parties in violation of our proprietary rights generally. The initiation of proceedings by third parties to challenge the scope or validity of our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Patent terms may result in inadequate protection for our product candidates, and we may be unable to obtain patent term extensions and data exclusivity for our product candidates, resulting in material harm to our business.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions such as patent term adjustments and/or extensions, may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Action of 1984, also known as the Hatch Waxman Amendments. The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the BLA, plus the time between the date of submission of the BLA and the date of FDA approval of the product.  The patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, the patents protecting our product candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration.  As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.</span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">99</p></div></div>

In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third-party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">In addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. If we choose to go to court to stop a third-party from using any of our trade secrets, we may incur substantial costs. These lawsuits may consume our time and other resources even if we are successful. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations, and our advice for best practices, in protecting our trade secrets.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Third parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used, disclosed, or misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, and although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and, if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. This type of litigation or proceeding could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources.

We have not yet demonstrated the ability to progress any of our product candidates through clinical trials, we have no products approved for commercial sale and we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we reported a net loss of $131.8 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $376.1 million. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, apitegromab and SRK-181, and any future product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">To become and remain profitable, we or any current or potential future collaborators must develop and eventually commercialize products with significant market potential and favorable pricing. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials, receiving marketing approval for product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling products for which we may receive marketing approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenue that is significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Even if we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders&#8217; equity and working capital.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">We will require additional capital to fund our operations and if we fail to obtain necessary capital, we will not be able to complete the development and commercialization of apitegromab, SRK-181 and any future product candidates.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception.

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $253.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Because the length of time and activities associated with development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities.

Private placements and other transactions that have occurred since our inception, as well as our Initial Public Offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;), may trigger such an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Code. Any such limitation, whether as the result of our IPO, prior private placements, sales of our common stock by our existing stockholders or additional sales of our common stock by us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future years. </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Risks Related to Our Common Stock</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">The price of our stock is volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;">Similar to the trading prices of the common stock of other biopharmaceutical companies, the trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume.

Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#8217;s securities.

If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline.

The stock market in general, and Nasdaq and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Our amended and restated bylaws contain certain exclusive forum provisions requiring that substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders be resolved in certain judicial forums, which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-weight:normal;white-space:pre-wrap;">Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws contain a provision by virtue of which, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts will be the exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions, however, stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.  We have chosen the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive forum for such causes of action because our principal executive offices are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some companies that have adopted similar federal district court forum selection provisions are currently subject to a suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware brought by stockholders who assert that the federal district court forum selection provision is not enforceable. While the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are &#8220;facially valid&#8221; under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our federal forum selection provision, and we may incur additional costs of litigation should such enforceability be challenged. If the federal forum selection provision is otherwise found inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We recognize that the federal district court forum selection clause may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert the provision is not enforceable and may impose more general additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Additionally, the choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs </span></p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">107</p></div></div>

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section&#160;27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section&#160;21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221; and are subject to the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; created by those sections. In particular, statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to statements regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects, including without limitation, our expectations regarding the potential of the TGF&#946; program, the potential of apitegromab as a therapy in SMA and the timeline for and progress in developing apitegromab, the potential of SRK-181 as a cancer immunotherapy and the timeline for and progress in developing SRK-181, and liquidity, constitute forward-looking statements and are made under these safe harbor provisions. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as &quot;believes,&quot; &quot;expects,&quot; &quot;may,&quot; &quot;will,&quot; &quot;should,&quot; &quot;could,&quot; &quot;seek,&quot; &quot;intends,&quot; &quot;plans,&quot; &quot;estimates,&quot; &quot;anticipates,&quot; or other comparable terms. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We caution readers not to place undue reliance upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We urge you to consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in greater detail under the heading &quot;Risk Factors&quot; elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our forward-looking statements. We have no plans to update our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth under the heading &quot;Risk Factors&quot; elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.</i></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Overview</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. Our novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled us to develop a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors. By targeting the signaling proteins at the cellular level and acting in the disease microenvironment, we believe we may avoid the historical dose-limiting safety challenges associated with inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect.

We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, including the development and deployment of any vaccine program. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, including our clinical trials, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions that have impacted our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access and monitor certain clinical trial sites, restrictions on clinical trial participants&#8217; ability to access our clinical trial sites and delays in enrollment. Some clinical trial participants have missed or experienced delays in receiving doses of study drug and completing their clinical trial assessments. For example, four patients (one in Cohort 2 and three in Cohort 3) of the TOPAZ clinical trial each missed three doses of apitegromab over the course of the 12-month treatment period due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions. This has affected our clinical trials and could result in further impacts, including delays in or adverse impacts to data readouts from our clinical trials, delays in our ability to identify and enroll patients in current or future clinical trials and decisions by enrolled patients to discontinue from our clinical trials due to COVID-19 related concerns. While our laboratory operations have resumed to near-normal capacity, we may continue to experience challenges in procuring materials and supplies, as well as research services from our vendors in a consistently timely manner due to COVID-19 related supply chain issues. Some of our third-party manufacturers have diverted resources or manufacturing capacity to accommodate the development or manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. Although this has not had an impact on our ability to produce sufficient quantities of apitegromab or SRK-181 for our clinical trials, we continue to work closely with our third-party manufacturers to mitigate potential impacts to our clinical supply chain. In addition, delays in the development of COVID-19 vaccines or the deployment of vaccines which are approved or otherwise authorized for emergency use, a recurrence or &#8220;subsequent waves&#8221; of COVID-19 cases, or the discovery of vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants could cause other widespread or more severe impacts. We continue to monitor developments as we adjust to the disruptions and evaluate the uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Financial Operations Overview</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Revenue</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">No revenues have been recorded from the sale of any commercial product.

Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development goods and services to be received in the future from third parties are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related services are performed.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">A significant portion of our research and development costs have been external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis after a clinical product candidate has been identified. However, we do not allocate our internal research and development expenses, consisting primarily of employee related costs, depreciation and other indirect costs, on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials, as well as the associated clinical trial material requirements. We expect research and development costs to increase for the foreseeable future as our product candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans. </p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">113</p></div></div>

ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.4 million, or 22.2%. The revenue for both of these periods was related to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement executed in December 2018. Revenue associated with the research and development and license performance obligations relating to the Gilead Programs was recognized as the research and development services were provided using a cost input method. The increase in revenue was attributable to the change in progress of the programs period over period as well as changes in estimates of the total costs expected to be incurred. The $33.2 million deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 is related to material rights that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the first quarter of 2022, as Gilead agreed in January 2022 that its option exercise period for all programs had been terminated. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Operating Expenses</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt;">Research and Development</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Research and development expense was $108.5 million for the&#160;year ended December&#160;31, 2021 compared to $74.1 million for the&#160;year ended December&#160;31, 2020, an increase of $34.4 million, or 46.5%.

approximately $88.0 million. The decrease was primarily due to cash used to operate our business, including payments related to, among other things, research and development and general and administrative expenses as we continued to invest in our primary product candidates and supported our internal research and development efforts, capital purchases, and interest payments on our debt, partially offset by proceeds of $13.1 million through an ATM sale, $25.0 million from Tranche 2 of the Loan and Security Agreement, as well as proceeds from stock option exercises. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">In October 2021, we sold 500,000 shares of our common stock through an ATM sale, pursuant to the Open Market Sale Agreement<sup style="font-size:7.5pt;line-height:100%;top:0pt;vertical-align:top;">SM</sup> with Jefferies, LLC, and received $13.1 million in net proceeds, after underwriting fees.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">In October 2020, we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 3,717,948 shares of our common stock at $39.00 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,179,487 shares of our common stock. The price of each pre-funded warrant was $38.9999, which equals the per share public offering price for the common shares less the $0.0001 exercise price for each such pre-funded warrant.

uncertain process that takes&#160;years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many&#160;years, if at all.

Market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting estimates are those most critical to the judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. They involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our finance condition or result of operations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Accrued Research and Development Expenses</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. In certain instances, we prepay for services to be provided in the future. These amounts are expensed as the services are performed.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense.

To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts incurred. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The accrued research and development expenses at the end of each year are generally paid during the following year and therefore the same estimates and assumptions do not continue to exist each year, although, as described above, the method and procedures to develop those estimates and assumptions are generally consistent. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Revenue Recognition</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">No revenues have been recorded from the sale of any commercial product. Revenue generation activities have been limited to collaborations, containing research services and the issuance of a license. Currently, revenue is being recognized related to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement which was executed in December 2018. We began recognizing associated revenue in 2019 over the period that research is performed under the collaboration. We account for revenue under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii) measurement of the transaction price, (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to our customer.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Identification of the Contract(s) with the Customer</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We account for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of ASC 606 when all of the following criteria are met: (i) the arrangement has been approved by the parties and the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, (ii) each party&#39;s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iii) the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iv) the arrangement has commercial substance and (v) collection of substantially all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer is probable.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Identification of the Performance Obligations</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, we consider factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of our customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer&#8217;s discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying license relative to the option exercise price, including assumptions about technical feasibility and the probability of developing a candidate that would be subject to the option rights.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">121</p></div></div>
<div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;page-break-after:always;width:79.3%;border:0;margin:30pt 10.35% 30pt 10.35%;"></div><div style="max-width:100%;padding-left:10.35%;padding-right:10.35%;position:relative;"><div style="margin-top:21.6pt;min-height:41.75pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"><a href="#TOC"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">Table of Contents</span></a></p></div><div style="clear:both;max-width:100%;position:relative;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Determination of the Transaction Price</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We estimate the transaction price based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. We utilize either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We evaluate whether development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee&#39;s control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenue and earnings in the period of adjustment. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">For sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, we determine whether the sole or predominant item to which the royalties relate is a license. When the license is the sole or predominant item to which the sales-based royalty relates, we recognize revenue at the later of: (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any sales-based royalty revenue resulting from our arrangement.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Allocation of Transaction Price</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We allocate the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price. We must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We utilize key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Estimating costs for research and development programs is subjective as we estimate the costs anticipated to successfully complete the research performance obligations. As the research is novel, efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs at the beginning of the contract. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts we would expect to receive for satisfying each performance obligation.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><b style="font-weight:bold;">Recognition of Revenue</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We utilize judgment to determine whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. We determine the appropriate method of measuring progress performance obligations satisfied over time for purposes of recognizing revenue, such as by using an input method based on costs incurred compared to the costs expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy the performance obligation. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The estimated remaining costs is highly subjective, as the research is novel, therefore efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs made at the balance sheet date. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">We receive payments from customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Up-front payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until we perform our obligations under these arrangements. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional.</p></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">122</p></div></div>

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation</b></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Organization</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Scholar Rock Holding Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. The Company&#8217;s novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled the development of a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors. The Company&#8217;s first product candidate, apitegromab (formerly SRK-015), is a highly selective, fully human, monoclonal antibody, with a unique mechanism of action that results in inhibition of the activation of the growth factor, myostatin, in skeletal muscle. Apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-directed therapy for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (&#8220;SMA&#8221;). The Company is conducting SAPPHIRE, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apitegromab in patients with non-ambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA. The Company&#8217;s second product candidate, SRK-181, is being developed for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitor (&#8220;CPI&#8221;) therapies, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody therapies. SRK-181 is a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent transforming growth factor beta-1 (&#8220;TGF&#946;1&#8221;) that is being investigated in the Company&#8217;s DRAGON Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies. The DRAGON trial consists of two parts: Part A (dose escalation of SRK-181 as a single-agent or in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy) and Part B (dose expansion evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD- (L)1 antibody therapy). Part B encompasses five cohorts, including urothelial carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and other solid tumors and commenced in 2021. Additionally, the Company continues to create a pipeline of product candidates to deliver novel therapies to underserved patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, and fibrosis. The Company was originally formed in May 2012. Its principal offices are in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Since its inception, the Company&#8217;s operations have focused on research and development of monoclonal antibodies that selectively inhibit activation of growth factors for therapeutic effect, as well as establishing the Company&#8217;s intellectual property portfolio and performing research and development activities. The Company has primarily financed its operations through various equity financings (Note 8), as well as research and development collaboration agreements and the Company&#8217;s debt facility (Note 12).</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Revenue generation activities have been limited to <ix:nonFraction unitRef="Unit_Standard_item_rAxpyfJY10qcWLRgFcNi8A" contextRef="Duration_1_1_2021_To_12_31_2021_ajDkw4FWJ0-Xy2swZOwH1g" decimals="INF" format="ixt-sec:numwordsen" name="srrk:NumberOfAgreements" scale="0" id="Narr_dFIIWXF2-kOjfwvf77wMLg">two</ix:nonFraction> collaborations, both containing research services and the issuance of a license. The first agreement, executed in 2013, was with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (&#8220;Janssen&#8221;), a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson. The second agreement (the &#8220;Gilead Collaboration Agreement&#8221;), executed in December 2018, was with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (&#8220;Gilead&#8221;). No revenues have been recorded from the sale of any commercial product.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, successful discovery and development of its drug candidates, raising additional capital, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology and regulatory approval and market acceptance of the Company&#8217;s product candidates. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as it continues to develop its product candidates. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operations through at least a period of one year after the date these financial statements are issued.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Basis of Presentation</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scholar Rock Holding Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset group for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset group to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset group are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset group over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. The Company did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets during the&#160;years ended December&#160;31, 2021 or 2020.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2021_To_12_31_2021_ajDkw4FWJ0-Xy2swZOwH1g" name="us-gaap:LesseeLeasesPolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_k1D0lnglEUqmfmZ55UQDbg" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Leases</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company accounts for leases using ASC Topic 842, Leases (&#8220;ASC 842&#8221;). At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its estimated incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In accordance with the guidance in ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g. land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g. property taxes, insurance, etc.). Then the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. For operating leases, lease expense relating to fixed payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term and lease expense relating to variable payments is expensed as incurred.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2021_To_12_31_2021_ajDkw4FWJ0-Xy2swZOwH1g" name="us-gaap:FairValueOfFinancialInstrumentsPolicy" id="Tb_7pboIuuqlEqPPuKPJuGdVg" continuedAt="Tb_7pboIuuqlEqPPuKPJuGdVg_cont1" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Fair Value Measurements</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (&quot;ASC 820&quot;), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company&#8217;s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company&#8217;s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. ASC 820 identifies fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.

Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i)&#160;identification of the contract(s)&#160;with the customer, (ii)&#160;identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, (iii)&#160;measurement of the transaction price, (iv)&#160;allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v)&#160;recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company accounts for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of ASC 606 when all of the following criteria are met: (i)&#160;the arrangement has been approved by the parties and the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, (ii)&#160;each party&#8217;s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iii)&#160;the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified, (iv)&#160;the arrangement has commercial substance and (v)&#160;collection of substantially all of the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer is probable.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company first evaluates license and/or collaboration arrangements to determine whether the arrangement (or part of the arrangement) represents a collaborative arrangement pursuant to ASC Topic 808,&#160;<i style="font-style:italic;">Collaborative Arrangements,</i>&#160;based on the risks and rewards and activities of the parties pursuant to the contractual arrangement.

As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must use significant judgment to determine: a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract; b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and c) the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. The Company uses judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are&#160;satisfied. In determining the stand-alone selling price of a license to the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology or a material right provided by a customer option, the Company considers market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its estimated stand-alone selling prices, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its estimated stand-alone selling prices will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between performance obligations.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:2pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><span style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the variable consideration is included in the transaction price.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i)&#160;the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii)&#160;the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company allocates the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price. The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Estimating costs for research and development programs is subjective as the Company estimates the costs anticipated to successfully complete the research performance obligations. As the research is novel, efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs at the beginning of the contract. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts the Company would expect to receive for each performance obligation.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;">For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation in order to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. The Company determines the appropriate method of measuring progress of combined performance obligations satisfied over time for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The estimated remaining costs is highly subjective, as the research is novel, therefore efforts to be successful may be significantly different than the estimated costs made at the balance sheet date.

The Company receives payments from customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Up-front payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12&#160;months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12&#160;months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company&#8217;s right to consideration is unconditional.

In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, the Company considers relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the collaboration partner can benefit from the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the arrangement.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;">&#160;</span></p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:2pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Research and Development Services &#8211;&#160;</i>The promises under the Company&#8217;s collaboration and license agreements generally include research and development services to be performed by the Company on behalf of the collaboration partner. For performance obligations that include research and development services, the Company generally recognizes revenue allocated to such performance obligations based on an appropriate measure of progress. The Company utilizes judgment to determine the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue, which is generally an input measure, such as costs incurred. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period as described under&#160;<i style="font-style:italic;">Exclusive Licenses&#160;</i>above. Reimbursements from the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are generally recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:12pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Customer Options &#8211;&#160;</i>The Company&#8217;s arrangements may provide a collaborator with the right to certain optional purchases, such as the right to license a target either at the inception of the arrangement or within a pre-defined option period. Under these agreements, fees may be due to the Company (i)&#160;at the inception of the arrangement as an upfront fee or payment or (ii)&#160;upon the exercise of an option to acquire a license.&#160;If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. The Company evaluates the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates the transaction price to material rights based on the relative stand-alone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount, and the probability that the customer will exercise the option.

If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of the Company or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company reevaluates the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to the Company&#8217;s efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, the Company generally allocates the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:12pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><i style="font-style:italic;">Royalties &#8211;&#160;</i>For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted entirely of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities during the period ending December 31, 2021 and 2020.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2021_To_12_31_2021_ajDkw4FWJ0-Xy2swZOwH1g" name="us-gaap:EarningsPerSharePolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_H0On4cS9Mkqhwj48wALigA" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Net Loss per Share</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company applies the two-class method to compute basic and diluted net loss per share because it has issued shares that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income (losses) available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income (losses) for the period had been distributed. During periods of loss, there is no allocation required under the two-class method since the participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to fund the losses of the Company.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including pre-funded warrants and excluding restricted common stock. The Company calculates diluted net loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, as applicable, after giving consideration to the dilutive effect of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, warrants, pre-funded warrants, and stock options that are outstanding during the period. </p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2021_To_12_31_2021_ajDkw4FWJ0-Xy2swZOwH1g" name="us-gaap:IncomeTaxPolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_iM9CWXvzZ06uKE7eC7WtAQ" continuedAt="Tb_iM9CWXvzZ06uKE7eC7WtAQ_cont1" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Income Taxes</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (&quot;ASC 740&quot;), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax basis. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the&#160;years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. </p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions, as necessary. The tax benefits recorded are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is &quot;more likely than not&quot; to be realized following resolution of any uncertainty related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities.</p></ix:nonNumeric></ix:continuation></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">F-14</p></div></div>

Marketable securities with a remaining maturity date greater than one&#160;year are classified as non-current. Marketable securities are maintained by an investment manager and consist of U.S. treasury securities. Marketable securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders&#8217; equity until realized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the underlying marketable security.</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Although available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise, securities are generally held through maturity. The cost of securities sold is determined on a specific identification basis, and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense) within the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

When assessing marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in value, the Company considers such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a&#160;percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the Company&#8217;s ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and market conditions in general. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment that the Company considers to be &quot;other than temporary,&quot; the Company would reduce the investment to fair value through a charge to the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. No such adjustments were necessary during the periods presented.</p></ix:nonNumeric><ix:nonNumeric contextRef="Duration_1_1_2021_To_12_31_2021_ajDkw4FWJ0-Xy2swZOwH1g" name="us-gaap:NewAccountingPronouncementsPolicyPolicyTextBlock" id="Tb_P_4x16BzoUmyTRSgVDIeRg" escape="true"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</p><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, <i style="font-style:italic;">Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments</i>. The standard requires that a financial asset or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Under current GAAP, a company only considered past events and current conditions in measuring an incurred loss. Under ASU 2016-13, the information that a company must consider is broadened in developing an expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The use of forecasted information incorporates more timely information in the estimate of expected credit loss. The guidance is applied using a modified retrospective, or prospective approach, depending on a specific amendment. In November 2019, the FASB deferred the effective date for smaller reporting companies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not anticipate a material impact to its net financial position or disclosures as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13. </p></ix:nonNumeric></ix:continuation></div><div style="clear:both;margin-bottom:30pt;width:100%;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:24pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;">F-15</p></div></div>
