tangible book value of the securities you purchase representing the difference between our as adjusted net tangible book value per share
after giving effect to this offering and the public offering price per share of common stock, assuming no exercise of the pre-funded warrants
and excluding any resulting accounting associated with the pre-funded warrants. The exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants
will result in further dilution of your investment. Furthermore, if the pre-funded warrants are exercised, you will incur further dilution.
See the section titled &ldquo;Dilution&rdquo; in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement for a more detailed illustration of the dilution
you would incur if you participate in this offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Based on the public offering price of $&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;per
share of common stock, we estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants
in this offering that we are offering will be approximately $&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;million, or approximately
$&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;&numsp;million if the option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full by the underwriters,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will receive nominal proceeds,
if any, upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We expect to use the net proceeds received from this offering
to advance SRK-015 in SMA, including costs associated with preparing for and executing clinical trials (including a Phase&nbsp;3
clinical trial), SRK-181 in cancer immunotherapy, development of our preclinical and discovery programs, as well as for working
capital and other general corporate purposes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license,
acquire or invest in new businesses, technologies or assets. Although we have no current agreements, commitments or understandings
with respect to any such in-license or acquisition, we evaluate such opportunities and engage in related discussions with third
parties from time to time. We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon
the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amount and timing
of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our research and development efforts, the
timing of regulatory submissions and the feedback from regulatory authorities, the timing and success of our clinical trials,
preclinical studies, or studies or trials we may commence in the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into
with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will have broad discretion
over the use of the net proceeds from this offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Pending the application of the net proceeds as described above
or otherwise, we plan to invest the proceeds in direct obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies or other securities,
including money market funds registered according to SEC Rule&nbsp;2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The following is a brief summary of certain terms and conditions
of the pre-funded warrants being offered by us. The following description is subject in all respects to the provisions contained
in the pre-funded warrants.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The pre-funded warrants will be issued as individual warrant
agreements to each individual purchaser of a pre-funded warrant. The form of pre-funded warrant will be filed as an exhibit to
a Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The pre-funded warrants are exercisable at any time after their
original issuance. The pre-funded warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, by delivering
to us a duly executed exercise notice and by payment in full of the exercise price in immediately available funds for the number
of shares of our common stock purchased upon such exercise. As an alternative to payment of the exercise price in immediately available
funds, the holder may elect to exercise the pre-funded warrant through a cashless exercise, in which case the holder would receive
upon such exercise the net number of shares of our common stock determined according to the formula set forth in the pre-funded
warrants. No fractional shares of our common stock will be issued in connection with the exercise of a pre-funded warrant. In lieu
of fractional shares, we will pay the holder an amount in cash equal to the fractional amount multiplied by the last closing trading
price of our common stock on the exercise date.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Under the pre-funded warrants, we may not effect the exercise
of any pre-funded warrant, and a holder will not be entitled to exercise any portion of any pre-funded warrant, which, upon giving
effect to such exercise, would cause (i)&nbsp;the aggregate number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the holder
(together with its affiliates) to exceed 9.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to the exercise, or (ii)&nbsp;the combined voting power of our securities beneficially owned by the holder (together with
its affiliates) to exceed 9.99% of the combined voting power of all of our securities then outstanding immediately after giving
effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the pre-funded warrants. However,
any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 19.99% upon at least 61 days&rsquo;
prior notice from the holder to us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The exercise price per whole share of our common stock purchasable
upon the exercise of the pre-funded warrants is $0.0001 per share of our common stock. The exercise price of the pre-funded warrants
and the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants are subject to appropriate adjustment
in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events
affecting our common stock and also upon any distributions of assets, including cash, stock or other property to our stockholders.
The exercise price will not be adjusted below the par value of our common stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Subject to applicable laws, the pre-funded warrants may be offered
for sale, sold, transferred or assigned without our consent. The pre-funded warrants will be held in definitive form by the warrant
agent. The ownership of the pre-funded warrants and any transfers of the pre-funded warrants will be registered in a warrant register
maintained by the warrant agent. We will initially act as warrant agent.</P>

with or into another person, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, the acquisition of, or
any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of, more than 50% of the voting power represented by our outstanding common stock, or
the reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of our common stock upon consummation of such a fundamental transaction,
the holders of the pre-funded warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants the kind and amount
of securities, cash or other property that the holders would have received had they exercised the pre-funded warrants immediately
prior to such fundamental transaction without regard to any limitations on exercise contained in the pre-funded warrants.</P>

any voting rights or the rights to receive dividends, until the holder exercises the pre-funded warrant.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Although it is not entirely free from doubt, a pre-funded warrant
should be treated as a share of our common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes and a holder of a pre-funded warrant should
generally be taxed in the same manner as a holder of common stock. Accordingly, no gain or loss should be recognized upon the exercise
of a pre-funded warrant and, upon exercise, the holding period of a pre-funded warrant should carry over to the share of common
stock received. Similarly, the tax basis of a pre-funded warrant should carry over to the share of common stock received upon exercise,
increased by the exercise price (if applicable). Each holder of pre-funded warrants should consult his, her or its own tax advisor
regarding the risks associated with the acquisition of pre-funded warrants pursuant to this offering (including potential alternative
characterizations).</P>
