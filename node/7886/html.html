Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) entered into an underwriting agreement (the &#8220;Underwriting Agreement&#8221;) with
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Jefferies LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters
named therein (the &#8220;Underwriters&#8221;), relating to the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 2,948,718 shares (the &#8220;Firm
Shares&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) and, in lieu of
Common Stock to certain investors,&#160;pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,179,487 shares of Common Stock (the &#8220;Pre-Funded
Warrants&#8221;) to the Underwriters (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company also granted
the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 769,230 additional shares (the &#8220;Option Shares&#8221; and together with
the Firm Shares, the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) of Common Stock.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Shares will be sold to the
purchasers at a public offering price of $39.00 per share and the Pre-Funded Warrants will be sold at a public offering price
of $38.9999 per Pre-Funded Warrant, which equals the per share public offering price for the Shares less the $0.0001 exercise
price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant.</p>

customary representations and warranties, conditions to closing, market standoff provisions, termination provisions and
indemnification obligations, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities
Act&#8221;). The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Underwriting Agreement were made only for
purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, and were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Underwriting
Agreement. <span style="background-color: white">The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the Offering will be
approximately $187.6&#160;million, or approximately $215.8&#160;million if the Underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase the Option Shares, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The
Offering is expected to close on or about November 2, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.&#160;</span></p>

at any time after the date of issuance. A holder of Pre-Funded Warrants may not exercise the warrant if the holder, together with
its affiliates, would beneficially own more than 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to such exercise. A holder of Pre-Funded Warrants may increase or decrease this percentage not in excess of 19.99%
by providing at least 61 days&#8217; prior notice to the Company.</p>

and Procedures.</I> If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall
be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to the preceding paragraphs
of this Section&nbsp;7, such person (the &ldquo;Indemnified Person&rdquo;) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification
may be sought (the &ldquo;Indemnifying Person&rdquo;) in writing; <U>provided</U> that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person
shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under the preceding paragraphs of this Section&nbsp;7 except to the extent
that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and <U>provided</U>,
<U>further</U>, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to
an Indemnified Person otherwise than under the preceding paragraphs of this Section&nbsp;7. If any such proceeding shall be brought
or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person,
be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Section&nbsp;that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred and documented
fees and expenses in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred and documented fees and expenses of such counsel related
to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Person
and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable
time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii)&nbsp;the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying
Person; or (iv)&nbsp;the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person
and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding
or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition
to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are
incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter
shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who
signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying
Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such
consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person
from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at
any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses
of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
without its written consent if (i)&nbsp;such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person
of such request and (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such
request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person,
effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been
a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x)&nbsp;includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person,
from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y)&nbsp;does not include any statement as to or
any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.</FONT></P>

If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient
in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph,
in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i)&nbsp;in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, from the offering of the Securities

or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one
hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting
expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received
by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the
aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other,

omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and

(d)&nbsp;above were determined by <U>pro rata</U> allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose)
or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d)&nbsp;above.
The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph
(d)&nbsp;above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any documented legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (d)&nbsp;and
(e), in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting
discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any
damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f)&nbsp;of the Securities
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters&rsquo;
obligations to contribute pursuant to paragraphs (d)&nbsp;and (e)&nbsp;are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations

generally be taxed in the same manner as a holder of common stock. Accordingly, no gain or loss should be recognized upon the exercise
of a pre-funded warrant and, upon exercise, the holding period of a pre-funded warrant should carry over to the share of common
stock received. Similarly, the tax basis of a pre-funded warrant should carry over to the share of common stock received upon exercise,
increased by the exercise price (if applicable). Each holder of pre-funded warrants should consult his, her or its own tax advisor

Rock is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines for the treatment
of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. Scholar Rock is creating a pipeline
of novel product candidates with the potential to transform the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases,
including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, fibrosis and anemia. Scholar Rock&#8217;s approach to targeting the molecular mechanisms
of growth factor activation enabled it to develop a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies
that locally and selectively target these signaling proteins at the cellular level. By developing product candidates that act
in the disease microenvironment, the Company intends to avoid the historical challenges associated with inhibiting growth factors
for therapeutic effect. Scholar Rock believes its focus on biologically validated growth factors may facilitate a more efficient
development path.</FONT></P>

Rock is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines for the treatment
of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. Scholar Rock is creating a pipeline
of novel product candidates with the potential to transform the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases,
including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, fibrosis and anemia. Scholar Rock&#8217;s approach to targeting the molecular mechanisms
of growth factor activation enabled it to develop a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies
that locally and selectively target these signaling proteins at the cellular level. By developing product candidates that act
in the disease microenvironment, the Company intends to avoid the historical challenges associated with inhibiting growth factors
for therapeutic effect. Scholar Rock believes its focus on biologically validated growth factors may facilitate a more efficient
development path.</FONT></P>
